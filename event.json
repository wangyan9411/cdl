Returning to the capital following an unstoppable takeover at South West Four in August, the world\u2019s #1 club is ready to demonstrate its brilliance once again. This forms Amnesia\u2019s next global event following its annual closing party making this one of London\u2019s most exciting parties of 2016.\n\nHeadlining this colossal party is one of Amnesia\u2019s greatest ever legends and favourite underground selectors. Having played a pivotal role in the clubs development over the past two decades, Paco Osuna is admired for his intelligent and sophisticated methods and extraordinary awareness of sound aesthetics. A favourite at Amnesia\u2019s Music On, the Barcelona-born DJ has formed an unbreakable bond with the underground as he effortlessly grooves his way across the globe stopping off at its most prestigious parties and locations. Heavily supported by the likes of Marco Carola, Richie Hawtin and Carl Cox, we can\u2019t wait to welcome Paco Osuna, one of the world\u2019s greatest techno talents. \n\nJoining him at Electric Brixton will be French mixing maestro Agoria, whose unique exploration of house and techno provides a diverse yet addictive underground sound. His work across Innervisions, Hotflush and Kompakt has continued to back up his unprecedented abilities even further along with regular dates across Europe including DC-10, Pacha, Awakenings and more. As a rare performer in London we\u2019re extremely excited to welcome Agoria\u2019s explicit talents with open arms as he takes us on a journey from one end of the spectrum to the other. From remixing the likes of Moby to Metronomy, the addition of Agoria is huge.\n\nFollowing several stunning sets at Amnesia and a brilliant debut at South West Four as part of Amnesia\u2019s brilliant showcase, Cuartero has become more than just an underground star and has now formed into an internationally-renowned rising talent. His multi-layered tracks and serious groove influences have made his performances incredibly invigorating, and we guarantee a fine selection of fresh cuts, beefy basslines and Balearic jams will be delivered by the Spanish favourite. Fresh from a string of high-end parties such as Elrow, Music On and Hyte, it comes as no surprise he\u2019s marked as one of the futures most promising stars.\n\nAs the creative director and resident DJ of Amnesia Ibiza, Mar-T is one of the most experienced jockeys on the planet and boasts an impressive list of achievements and releases. Recognised as the perfect connoisseur of the dancefloor, his sets expose his hedonist and sensual spirit, his ability to create electric atmospheres full of good vibrations is second to none. Mar-T\u2019s last London visit saw him bring Amnesia to South West Four for a truly remarkable display and with his next already shaping up to be a huge affair, excitement is already at boiling point. Eletric Brixton get ready for the Wow! Recordings boss to land with a bang.\n\nCompleting this forward-thinking line-up will be techno breakthrough star Fer BR [Live]. Creator of energetic and futuristic, groove-laden techno, FeR BR is not only the pride of Spain\u2019s thriving underground music scene, but is without a doubt, one of the most creative artists worldwide. His diverse influences and constantly surprising tracks make sure that no two of his sets sound alike, and with his regular appearances at Amnesia\u2019s Music On it\u2019s clear that this is not to be missed. Globally marked as one to watch, we\u2019re excited to add Fer BR to London.\n\nRegister now at www.amnesialondon.com  \n\nElectric Brixton, Town Hall Parade, London, SW2 1RJ\nOpen from 10pm \u2013 7am\nFully licensed bar until close\nNearest Tube: Brixton (Victoria Line) / Stockwell (Northern Line)", "location": {"city": "London", "zip": "SW2 1", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": -0.11628, "street": "Town Hall Parade", "latitude": 51.46028, "id": "168451269887426"}}, "311244072570647": {"loc_name": "The Leavenworth Snow Train", "description": "Join Alki Tours on The Leaveworth Snow Train as we Journey to see the one of the top rated Christmas Tree Lighting Festivals in the country - Check out our website for details", "location": {"city": "Leavenworth", "country": "United States", "longitude": -120.665, "state": "WA", "latitude": 47.5964, "id": "107886185907007"}}, "485894658146587": {"loc_name": "Million Mask March London", "description": "Description\n\nThis November 5th, the Anonymous UK collective will again descend on central London. \nWe have seen the abuses and malpractice of this government, and governments before it, we have seen the encroaching destruction of many civil liberties we hold dear, we have seen the pushes to make the internet yet another part of the surveillance state, we have seen the government's disregard for migrants, for the poor, the elderly and the Disabled, we have seen the capital, profit and greed of the few put before the well-being of the many and we say enough is enough.\n\n\nWe invite all the activists, the workers, the students, all doctors, nurses and all those that want to see a positive change in the world, to join us, in Trafalgar Square from 6pm, November 5th.

Sgt Alexander Blackman otherwise known as Marine A has served this country proudly for 17 years that included several operation tours fo duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nWhilst fighting the war in Afghanistan in 2011\u2026\n\nSergeant Blackman was posted to the remote command post Omar, with 15 younger Royal Marines under his command. They lived for more than six months in a small mud enclosure, in appalling conditions of physical discomfort. Daily, they patrolled on foot for up to 10 hours in a large hostile area where the Taliban were most active. IEDs, or improvised explosive devices, the roadside landmines favoured by the Taliban, were a constant threat, to the extent that the troop seldom used their vulnerable Jackal vehicle, preferring to patrol on foot instead. They were aware that hundreds of their comrades had already been killed or maimed by IEDs. The psychological impact was devastating. Firefights with the Taliban were common. So, too, were deaths and life-threatening injuries. Overall, 42 Commando lost seven men, and a further 45 were injured, many of them very seriously indeed.\n\nOn 15 September 2011, towards the end of their fraught tour, Sergeant Blackman and his patrol were directed to an insurgent who had been fatally wounded by gunfire from an Apache helicopter. Horribly exposed in a known hotspot for enemy activity, they knew that other insurgents were in the area. They dragged the fatally wounded man to cover. Sergeant Blackman then shot what he believed to be a dead Taliban insurgent who had been shooting at his fellow Royal Marine colleague\u2019s minutes earlier. \n\nFollowing the Court Martial and a failed appeal Claire and the family submitted an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) on the 16th of December 2015 requesting that his case be reviewed and referred back to the Court of Appeal. This case was originally given priority 2, however after much consideration this was increased to priority 1 which meant that the case would be allocated  caseworker within 3 months of receiving the application instead of approximately 9 months. The CCRC have recently updated us with the fact they are making progress reviewing the case which includes going through in excess of 69 boxes of evidence and speaking to individuals involved in the case. \n\nThis is a legal process being conducted by an independant body and that must be respected. We do not believe putting pressure on the CCRC would be within the best interests of the campaign.\n\nAs this is an extremely complex case we have been advised that it could take approximately several months before a decision is made. From there the appeal will be given a date and what we are hoping is where the final battle begins.\n\nAll that said we feel that one of our own has been let down and would really appreciate if you can make it down to London to show not only the Nation but the world that we leave no man behind and truly support those that put their lives on the line for us all. \n\nFore more information on the campaign please visit our website: www.justiceformarineA.com\n\nMore updates to follow shortly......", "location": {"city": "London", "zip": "SW1A 2", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": -0.12666666666667, "street": "sq.

This anniversary release reminds us of that and the growth of a talent that has toured the UK and globally, all whilst being largely ignored by mainstream radio for the past decade. Last year alone, Akala headlined 4 sold out shows in London (2 at the Jazz Cafe\u0301, Rich Mix and Village Underground) addressed the Oxford Union and released part 2 of Knowledge is Power. His live show is 90 minutes of relentless tracks, backed by intense and stunning visuals, live drums, a DJ and with no need for a \u2018hype man\u2019. 2016\u2019s upcoming tour in October promises to be his biggest yet, with a London show at Koko, UK, US, European and Australian dates also to be announced. Fresh from an East Africa mini tour (Addis, Khartoum & Juba) Akala is ready to take on the world again in 2016.\n\nWith part 4 of his legendary Fire In The Booth eagerly anticipated for later this year, an appearance on BBC2 & the RSC\u2019s Shakespeare 400th birthday celebrations collaborating with Nitin Sawney and a reggae documentary on BBC4 to be broadcast in October, 2016 will continue to be a year of solid progress and groundbreaking, pathmaking vision from this artistic polymath.\n\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nTICKETS:\n\nBOOKING ONLINE: www.junction.co.uk/akala\n\nBOOKING IN PERSON:\nYou can buy or collect your tickets prior to the event from:\n\nTHE JUNCTION BOX OFFICE: Cambridge Leisure Park, Clifton Way, Cambridge, CB1 7GX.\n\nBOOKING BY PHONE:\nPlease call 01223 511 511\n\n(You must bring the card on which the tickets were purchased when you collect your tickets)\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nProudly presented by:\nEdwartainments\nwww.edwartainments.com\nCambridge Junction\nwww.junction.co.uk", "location": {"city": "Cambridge", "zip": "CB1 7GX", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": 0.13636323916816, "street": "Cambridge Leisure park, Clifton Way", "latitude": 52.190539592503, "id": "109367642450438"}}, "1024976720925863": {"loc_name": "London Calling Festival met oa Wild Beasts, Explosions in the Sky, Allah-Las, Silversun Pickups en meer", "description": "Het popfestival London Calling, dat plaatsvindt in Paradiso, begon in 1992 als showcasefestival voor de nieuwste beloftes uit Groot-Brittanni\u00eb.

Combining Nile\u2019s upbeat sounds with Laura\u2019s characteristic thrilling harmonies layered beneath stunning tribal beats may come as a surprise to many, but the final product is a true testa-ment to both artists musical talents and a clear development from Laura\u2019s debut album.  \n\nAs one of the most exciting musical talents to come out of the UK, Laura has cer-tainly come along way since writing songs at home on her laptop.

And we'll be there! Visit and LIKE the WYD London 2022 page here to support the cause:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WYDLondon2022?hc_location=stream\n\nWe could put on the best WYD there has ever been. Why? Because of the faith and energy of young Catholics here, the sense of renewal and hope within the Catholic Church in this country, the pull of the English language, and the attraction of Britain as a destination for visitors. WYD 2016 will be in Krakow; WYD 2019 will probably be outside Europe; and so by 2022 it will be time to come to Britain! It seems like a long way off, but time passes quickly, and it will take a lot of planning ahead.\n\nWYD London would revitalise the Church and be an incredible witness to the people of this country. It would be a truly national event, bringing together every Catholic diocese, parish, group and movement. It wouldn't distract from other important pastoral priorities - instead it would provide a focus and stimulus for them. The period of planning and preparation would galvanise the Church at national and local levels. The \u2018Days in the Dioceses', in the week before WYD itself, would be a celebration of faith throughout the regions, with hundreds of thousands of international young pilgrims welcomed into parishes and families across Britain. And there could be an important ecumenical dimension too, with Catholics and other Christian communities cooperating in hospitality, witness and celebration.\n\nLondon would be the focus for the main WYD events and closing Mass. Why? Not because of some unthinking \u2018London-centric\u2019 prejudice in favour of the capital, but simply because of the practical advantages. London has the venues, the infrastructure, the transport, the public spaces - the sheer size; and it will have the experience of dealing with the Olympics. In the three dioceses that converge there (Westminster, Southwark and Brentwood), it has the greatest number of Catholic parishes and movements, the richest concentration of Catholic life, and an incomparable diversity of people and communities. And it has a unique pull in the international imagination. It would be \u2018London uniting the country and opening out to the world\u2019, rather than \u2018London excluding the regions\u2019.\n\nYes, there would be significant costs. But unlike Pope Benedict's visit to the UK in 2010, WYD would pay for itself. If just half a million pilgrims register (a conservative estimate), and the fee is just \u00a350, that's \u00a325m to start with, even before the serious fundraising has begun. And despite the misgivings of some, no-one seriously doubts that this kind of event brings massive economic benefits to the host country. The Papal visit, for example, brought an \u00a38.5m boost to Glasgow alone; and a \u00a312.5m boost to Birmingham. According to an independent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, WYD Madrid brought 354m Euros to Spain, and there are similar predictions for Rio [see links below]. This is one reason why the British Government and Mayor of London will surely be interested in it. But there would be deeper reasons are well: the opportunity of hosting what is perhaps the largest youth event in the world, of opening our doors to people from every corner of the earth, and of putting young people at the centre of the national agenda.\n\nAt the moment, this is an off-the-cuff, un-thought-out, testing-the-water kind of proposition. It began in the parks and cafes of Madrid at WYD 2011, when thousands of young people from the UK began to think \u2018We could do this!\u2019 It continued in a World Youth Day London 2016 Facebook Event, before Krakow was announced, which had 2,900 potential attendees - it's now been closed! And it continues now through this new WYD London 2022 Event.\n\nSo if you want to see it move forward, INVITE YOUR FRIENDS - TODAY!! \n\nWhat do you think?

Animal rights marches have happened before and there are vegan protests often in London but nothing before has happened on a big enough scale. \n\nMarches have helped rights campaigns throughout history and now it is the animals' turn to have their march for their rights. We want this march to be as large and historic as those which aided the campaigns for civil rights, gay rights, women's rights etc and for this to happen we must all participate, share the event and invite every vegan we know! Billions of animals are slaughtered, raped, tortured, mutilated and enslaved every year because their species is seen as inferior and it needs to stop. We ask vegans and animal rights enthusiasts of the world to come together in London on October 29th 2016 to finally bring the vegan movement the publicity it needs. \n\nVeganism has soared lately and has been publicised much more frequently and positively than before and when people see thousands and thousands of us marching through London next year it could be the step this movement needs. But this needs to be big, it needs to be historic. We want this to be the most important event in the history of animal rights and we need you all to join in to make that happen.\n\nSpread the word, share the event, tell everybody you know, the vegans are coming to London and they will not stand for the oppression of animals any longer.

These hikes support and spread our bottom line: \"put the gun back on safe, put it back on the nightstand, and stick around a bit longer.\"\n\nThe silkies hike combines some of the things Marines specifically love most in an effort to bring awareness to a serious issue: humor and very short shorts known as silkies.\n\nThe hike provides the therapy and treatment for veterans suffering from post traumatic stress and other stressors to effectively prevent suicide by using humor and camaraderie to heal mental wounds.\n\nWHAT:\nA 22km (13.6 mile) hike with 22 kg (optional) on our backs in silkies (optional) for military past and present.\n\nWHY:\nTo get our veterans together, to put weight on our backs, to feel nostalgic, to laugh, to bond and to remind us all that our camaraderie, brotherhood and sisterhood will never die.\n\nWHEN\nStep off at:\nTBA\n\nWHERE :\nTBA\n\n\nCivilians:\nPlease meet us for the initial festivities and also advance to the locations if you'd like to receive your veterans with cheers, hugs, kisses, photos, videos, screaming, yelling, and excessive PDA.\n\nUOD:\nMarines:\nGreen/Black silkies\nBody/face paint\nDesert/combat boots.\n\nSailors:\nGreen/blue/black silkies\nBody/face paint\nDesert/combat boots\n\nSoldiers:\nGreen/black silkies\nBody/face paint\nBanana hammocks\nBody/face paint\nDesert/combat boots\nYou can leave the gay reflective army belts at home...oh and the berets too.\n\nAirmen:\nGreen/blue/black/pink silkies\nBody/face paint\nDesert/combat boots...remember there is no air conditioning during the march because it's happening \"outside\" lol.\n\nCoasties:\nTurqoise/aquamarine/pink silkies with dolphin caricatures\nBody/face paint\nDesert/combat boots\nPrepare to hear Coastie jokes from your Navy brethren for the entirety of the march.\n\nGEAR LIST:\nBackpack - The 22 kg is optional\nSnacks - Nuts, bars, food that will fuel you throughout the day\nCamelback with water\nSunblock\nHeadgear - hat, kevlar\nEye Pro - Sunglasses, goggles\nVaseline and Mulskin\nTennis shoes and shower shoes\nExtra socks\nExtra shirt\nHoodie\nTylenol..er motrin..but seriously Tylenol for the hangover.\n\nTRANSPORTATION AND SAFETY:\n\nLEGAL STUFF:\n\nDont bring any weapons, weapon accessories, magazines, ammo, flash bangs, grenades, nuclear devices, WMDs or other illegal arms.\nWe will be going into public venues, so even if you are licensed for concealed carry - leave it.\n\nPublic drinking is illegal - there we said it.\n\nTo avoid throat punching liberal hippies please try to avoid engaging people in matters about politics, and the military that will end in us getting kicked out and arrested.\n\nDOs:\n\nDo \"check-in\" on Facebook as we progress through the hike.\nDo FLIRT with girls and invite them to the after party later that night.\nDo whatever it takes to help a fellow vet out\nDo mumble the words \"I love you\" to a bunch of dudes/dudettes you've never met.\nDO bring moto shirts and everything you own that is red, white, and blue.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\nFor machine gunners - Make something that mimics the weight of a 240 golf on your back and we'll pass it around.\n\nFor Corpsmen and Medics - rig an IV bag with a beverage you can pass around.\n\nBring your guidons, your American flags, your service branch flags and your moto voice for cadences.\n\nMORE ABOUT US:\n\nThe Silkies Hike is not about awareness, it's about prevention, because the connections and bonds that we make during the hike will become our support network for the rest of our lives.

Workers and passengers on the Underground have regularly reported unexplained incidents, including the sightings of the ghost of an actress who is regularly witnessed on Aldywch Station and the \"Black Nun\" at Bank Station. Eerie noises, such as the cries of 13 year-old Anne Naylor, who was murdered in 1758 at Farringdon Station, and the screams of children who were among the 173 people who were crushed to death in the London Underground\u2019s worst ever accident at Bethnal Green Station during World War II, are still heard echoing down the years. ALAN BROOKE will delve into these and other uncanny underground occurrences.\n\nGhostbuster ALAN MURDIE will examine the legends surrounding some of London\u2019s most famous supposedly haunted locations, ranging from a prison, a stately mansion, a court house and a West End cinema. What can we deduce about the nature of paranormal experiences and when they are most likely to happen? At a time where reportedly the average Briton is more likely to believe in ghosts than in God how is the evidence stacking up?\n\nAlan will also dispense practical tips for those wishing to embark on their own ghost hunting expeditions, stressing that the main item to keep with you at all times is an open mind.\n\nEach ticket includes a delightful gin cocktail and a 20% donation towards a host of restoration projects at Brompton Cemetery.\n\nSpeakers include:\n\nAlan Brooke\nAlan Brooke has over twenty years experience as a history lecturer to Higher Education level.

The departure from his band allowed Prince even more freedom in the studio and time to experiment. Initial plans for a triple LP project were balked at by Warner Bros (a fact that would later result in Prince publicly refusing to work and branding his deal \u201ca slave contract\u201d) and he was forced to scale back his plans to a mere double LP. The Linn LM-1 drum machine and Fairlight CMI feature heavily throughout the album, as do other effects that were being experimented with heavily at the time such as sped up vocals resulting in the arrival of Camille, Prince\u2019s alter ego.\n\nRead more here:\nhttp://classicalbumsundays.com/cas-cambridge-presents-prince-sign-o-the-times/\n\nWhilst reviewing the album for it\u2019s 25th anniversary Tom Brielhan noted, \u201cIt crystallised all the artistic experimentation of those previous two albums into something huge and tangible, displaying Prince as a musical adventurer without equal.

Formed in Ithaca, New York, in the mid 1990s, at a time when there wasn\u2019t yet a far-reaching U.S. reggae scene, JBB was one of a small handful of U.S. reggae bands that began touring nationally. Since then, JBB has played an important role in helping define distinctly \u201cAmerican reggae.\u201d JBB\u2019s music is steeped in traditional vibes, but unapologetically incorporates elements from other genres. While most American reggae bands tackled typical reggae themes (such as religion and marijuana), JBB acted more like an indie band, writing songs that used the vocabulary of reggae to express their own experiences. Their unique approach resonated with the masses. The group\u2019s 2008 full-length record, Amplify, hit #1 on the Billboard Reggae Chart, 2012\u2019s JBB In Dub EP reached #1 on iTunes\u2019 Reggae Chart, and in 2013 Kings And Queens topped both Billboard and iTunes Reggae Charts at #1. Today, JBB\u2019s signature style has become the norm for U.S. reggae bands - and many in the genre admittedly point to John Brown\u2019s Body as a key influence.

It took over two years, 250 Italian artisans, and $1.7 million dollars to build the hotel, which had its grand opening in 1902. Just one year after the hotel\u2019s completion, Mr. Stickney died suddenly, leaving the hotel to his wife, Princess Carolyn, who continued to summer at the hotel every year until her own death, over a decade later\n\nSince then, many guests of the hotel have come to believe that Princess Carolyn never completely left. Her apparition has been reported throughout the hotel and there is even a place set for her in the hotel dining room every evening. Perhaps most famously, the TAPS team, featured on the SyFy network show, Ghost Hunters, recorded clear EVP\u2019s of the Princess conversing with them. That ghostly conversation seemed to indicate that Carolyn is still very much present at the hotel, but either unsure or perhaps unaware of what time period she is in.\n\nIn addition to the ghost of the Princess, there have many reports of paranormal activity within the hotel including: children running the halls, a dark figure haunting the new spa wing, and the presence of a resident spirit belonging to an old employee who is rumored to have committed suicide in the staff quarters of one of the towers.\n\nWhen you join Strange Escapes for this three-night event, you will not only be looking for ghosts in areas of the hotel that aren\u2019t open to the public at any other time, you\u2019ll be surrounded by stunning, mountainside scenery while staying in one of the most luxurious, historical properties in New England.\n\nFeaturing Grant Wilson, Amy Bruni, Adam Berry, Chip Coffey, John Tenney, Greg Newkirk, Dana Mathews - and performances by Aiden Sinclair, Mike Brody and Raven Quinn.\n\n*Please note, this event is until the 14th!

We will hike day one of the Fynbos Trail \u2013 (7,5km)  guided by Sean Privett - http://www.fynbostrail.co.za \u2013 This was the same part of the trail that a few of us got to do on the Slack packing trail in March 2016 to this ancient forest where most of the trees are over 1000 years old. Time will also be allocated own time to relax, read, reflect swim in the two beautiful swimming dams, this will be great as it is summer time or just connect with like-minded people. Hearth & Soul is an eco-farm and spiritual retreat centre with a difference. Suitable for Most Levels of Fitness, but some minimum fitness is required.\n\nFrom our trip in March 2016 Hearth and Soul was recommended as a venue one of the favourite group venues to date.

Wherever possible we will share the Transport in getting there.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat is on offer: Two of the highlight experiences will be the Guided Fynbos Trail and the Trip down to Cape Agulhas Nature Reserve, the southern tip of Africa. A few of got to do the famous Fynbos Slack Packing Trail in Gansbaai area back in March 2016. We were so impressed by the diversity of the plant and tree species that by special arrangement we will be doing day one again, this time guided Sean Privett - http://www.fynbostrail.co.za \u2013 Sean also co-wrote the field Guide to the flora of Grootbos Nature Reserve. The hike includes time spent in the Steynsbos and Grootbos Milkwood forest \u2013 two of only eight milk wood forests of this kind in the world. Many of the trees here are over 1000 years old. Hikers also walk through limestone fynbos, a very rare fynbos type of which many species are only found in this small area. \n\nWe will also be visiting Cape Agulhas, which is located about an hour from where we staying. Once in the Reserve we will be doing the 5,5km Rasperpunt Hiking Trail along the coast and through the coastal fynbos. We will also visit the museum and do tour of the light house and learn a more about the history of this area. The sea off Cape Agulhas is notorious for winter storms and mammoth rogue waves, which can range up to 30 metres. This has been due to the two oceans meet in winter and the nature of the coastal shelf.  Over the past few hundred years it has been believed that around 150 ships have sunk around Agulhas. If it\u2019s warm day we will also stop for a swim in one of the tidal pools in the Indian Ocean\n\nWe will also be doing on one of the mornings a guided walk up to Pigs\u2019s Snout Kloof and the Waterfall trail located about 20min from where we are staying. Sybille at Heart & Soul is also in the process of setting up a new trail that we will also explore.\n\nThe scenic surroundings will provide an ideal space for relaxation and re-connecting within especially because we are there for an extended amount of days. Not to mention connecting with like-minded people who share similar soulful interests.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHearth & Soul is perfectly situated in a secluded valley between the hamlets of Stanford and Napier in the Sandy\u2019s Glen area, undoubtedly one of the Overberg\u2019s best-kept secrets. Hearth & Soul is located 24km from Stanford / or 175km from Cape Town.\n\nOur accommodation is situated on a working eco farm, accommodating 24 guests comfortably in 13 x bedrooms.

The setting also lends itself to magical weddings and unforgettable private functions with an intimate and natural flavour. The original farm buildings have been extensively and lovingly upgraded, in a conscious and eco-friendly manner. Our own poplar and blue-gum trees were used for beams and internal woodwork, adding to the unique charm of our venue. We are lucky to have our drinking water supplied directly via gravity-feed from a nearby mountain spring, and we pump from the perennial river to irrigate the farm lands.\n\nThe fully equipped farm house where we will be staying is very private and safe with magnificent views of the surrounding mountains. The kitchen is fully equipped with cookware, cutlery, crockery, cloths, dishwashing liquid etc. \n\nThe double-story Farmhouse has been lovingly restored, with reclaimed doors, roughly plastered walls, dakriet ceilings and beams hewn from local poplar trees among the special touches. The Farmhouse features a total of 13 bedrooms, each uniquely decorated in a mix of contemporary and antique furnishings, and accommodating two to three guests. Eleven of the rooms are en-suite, each with either a patio or balcony and gorgeous mountain views. \n\nThe communal living areas are spacious and creatively decorated, and the atmosphere homely. There\u2019s a lounge with fireplace, a patio with dining area and a laid-back farm-style kitchen with dining table. From here it's a step away to a comfy couch and fireplace in the sunroom. Step onto the rolling lawn and you\u2019ll find a central fire pit with communal seating on the banks of one of four farm dams. \n\nVisit the inspiring permaculture gardens, take in some of the lovely fynbos trails on the farm, or head out and explore the villages of Napier and Stanford. Or just hang out and enjoy this superb setting. \n\nTapping into natural resources\n\nHearth & Soul believe that art and nature have tremendous power and can help greatly with emotional, mental and creative blocks. Hearth & Soul is a store house of natural resources, including wood, bracken and all sorts of other bits and pieces with which to play and create! Their focus is on growth, but everything they do at Hearth & Soul is infused with JOY.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nABOUT \u2013 THE FRYNBOS TRAIL\nhttp://www.fynbostrail.co.za\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the Saturday we will be doing day one of the normal 3 day Slack Packing Fynbos Trail. The part that we will be doing of the Fynbos Trail \u2013 (7,5km) will be guided by Sean Privett - http://www.fynbostrail.co.za \u2013 This was the same part of the trail that a few of us got to do on the Slack packing trail in March 2016 to this ancient forest where most of the trees are over 1000 years old. This is certainly one of the oldest forests that I have been to before. Sean also co-wrote the field Guide to the flora of Grootbos Nature Reserve. The hike includes time spent in the Steynsbos and Grootbos Milkwood forest \u2013 two of only eight milk wood forests of this kind in the world. Hikers also walk through limestone fynbos, a very rare fynbos type of which many species are only found in this small area. \n\nThe trail starts at Growing the Future Sustainable Agriculture and Life Skills College on Grootbos Nature Reserve. From Growing the Future the trail leads through coastal strandveld into the Steynsbos Milkwood forest, one of only eight milkwood forests of its type in the world, all of which are found in the Stanford-Gansbaai area. An island surrounded by fynbos, this small patch of forest contains trees that are many hundreds, if not thousands of years old and is refuge for a number of animals and birds not commonly seen in the fynbos. Thirty four bird species, including Rameron pigeon, Cape Batis, African paradise flycatcher and forest buzzard have been sighted as well as a variety of mammals including bushbuck, porcupine, honey badger and mongoose. By hiking the trail you contribute directly towards the conservation and social development work of the partners within the conservancy. Some of the funds generated by the trail are re-invested into clearing alien vegetation, managing fire and documenting and monitoring flora and fauna within the conservancy.\n\nA true voyage of discovery, led by a passionate, expert guide who points out the various endemics and rare species and explains the that role the various birds, ants and other propagators play in the eco-system. More than 800 fynbos species have been identified along the route and, whatever time of year you walk there is always something in bloom. As you go you learn about the remarkable diversity and fascinating ecology of the proteas, ericas, reeds and wonderful bulbs, gaining an understanding of their preferred habitats and their remarkable tricks. The seeds of the local limestone pincushion (Leucospermum pattersoni) have a waxy coating that attract the local pugnacious ants, who carry the seeds to the safety of their underground nests, where ants are rewarded with nutritious seed coat as food and the seed is planted out of harm\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds way until a future fire activated germination!  \n\nAs you wander you begin to understand the uniqueness of this trail. Vegetation studies on Grootbos Nature Reserve have recorded six plant species that are new to science!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\nABOUT \u2013 CAPE AGULHAS NATIONAL PARK\nhttps://www.sanparks.org/parks/agulhas/tourism/activities.php\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the Sunday we will be visiting Agulhas National Park via Bredasdorp. Bredasdorp is also home to the Shipwreck Museum which tells the stories of the 150 ships that wrecked along the nearby Agulhas Reef. The only museum of its kind in the southern hemisphere.\n\nOnce in the national park, we will head down to the Southern most tip of Africa. The official position of the tip is 34\u00b0 49\u2019 58\" south and 20\u00b0 00\u2019 12\u2019\u2019 east. A cairn marks the tip\u2019s exact location. It is at this longitudinal point that the Atlantic and Indian oceans officially meet. We will visit the Cape Agulhas Lighthouse & Museum. The lighthouse was built to aid the early explorers on their passage of the rough seas off Cape Agulhas. Seventy-one steps lead up to the top of the second oldest working lighthouse in southern Africa. Stone mined from the adjacent limestone quarry provided the raw materials for its construction. The building also houses a unique lighthouse museum. Remains of ancient stone fish traps used by the Khoisan people can be seen to the east of the lighthouse.\n\n=> Rasperpunt Hiking Trail \n\nThis relaxing 5,5km circular hiking trail, with its start/end at the Meisho Maru shipwreck. Experience the coastline, coastal fynbos, ancient fish traps, fresh water fountains for the first half of the walk. Turn inland, cross the gravel road and work your way up the ridge with magnificent views of the Rasperpunt rock formations and the coastline. \n\nThe Agulhas Plain has great diversity of flora. The Agulhas area contains representatives of unique vegetation such as limestone fynbos. Although most species bloom between May and September, there are flowers to be enjoyed in any season. Explore the Agulhas Plain with its great diversity of indigenous flora, and unique vegetation such as limestone fynbos!\n\nTime permitting we will also stop for a swim in one of the tidal pools in Indian Ocean. \n\n------------------------------------------\nABOUT THE PIG\u2019S SNOUT KLOOF AND WATERFALL \n------------------------------------------\n\nThis will be a walk on private lands with special permission up to the kloof and the waterfall. There is also a great swimming spot. This is an interesting formation in the Kleinrivier Mountains locals call \u201cPig\u2019s Snout\u201d. Over millennia, this kloof has been eroded to resemble the face of a pig with two waterfalls neatly running down the \u201cnostrils\u201d.\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nYour time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.\n~ Steve Jobs\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n==> TOTAL COST & HOW TO BOOK\n\nCost: R 2000.00 per person or if you are not able to pay the full amount, then an R1000.00 Deposit to secure your booking.

(Antarctica always escapes us.) Just like our participants, this year's committees will be more numerous and more diverse than ever. With sixteen committees on offer, we have maintained a fair balance between old favourites alongside those committees whose innovativeness and originality make the CUIMUN brand: announcing in particular this year two exciting and unique simulations on the MUN circuit, the Emergency Special Session of the UNGA, and the Joint Regional Cooperation Session of the European Council and African Union.\n\nWe will also be offering our signature integrated four-cabinet Historical Crisis, promising another innovative and high-paced take on the original format for which CUIMUN has become rightly famous.\n\nIn keeping with our conference theme of 'Achieving Gender Equality', we are additionally proud to announce that we have at present achieved a gender-balanced chairing team across the conference, and that the UN Women committee will be given special pride of place at this year's CUIMUN.\n\nWith Study Guides due to be released at the end of the summer, and delegate and press applications still open till September (while spots last), now is the time to apply.\n\nFor reasons of general inclusivity and through the generosity of our sponsors, we have been able to ensure that our delegate and social fees have been kept to a historic low (\u00a340 delegate fee, with an optional \u00a330 social or \u00a320 half-social pack), while continuing to improve on the overall quality of the conference. We are thus confident that this year's edition will be only the most affordable but also the best-value international conference on this scale in 2016. For the additional benefit of delegations coming from outside of Europe and wanting to take in two conferences, we have continued our co-ordination with OxiMUN for the second year running, which will be hosted the weekend after CUIMUN.\n\nNot yet convinced? Then check out our socials page. In addition to our secret Friday night social, you will have the privilege on Saturday of dining in some of Cambridge's oldest and most elegant dining halls \u2013 yes, just like in Harry Potter. Following this exquisite dinner, you will kick the suits, ties, dresses and heels on your way to an epic club-night. All of this in the beautiful city of Cambridge, home of Europe's third oldest university -- and the architecture\u2019s pretty striking too!\n\nFor more info, and where to sign up, visit: http://cuimun.org/\n\nBe sure to sign up for CUIMUN XXII to take part in the longest established and best MUN experience the UK has to offer!\n\n#CUIMUNXXII #Feeling22", "location": {"city": "Cambridge", "zip": "CB2", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": 0.16392, "street": "Old Schools Lane", "latitude": 52.24215, "id": "210653859001237"}}, "1784272335188117": {"loc_name": "Propaganda Cambridge Disney Party 14/10/16", "description": "Join us for a huge Disney Party!

Considered Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO since 2010, the Spanish Riding School in Vienna continues to delight both connoisseurs and newcomers to horsemanship almost half a millennium since its foundation in 1565. \n\nTo celebrate this landmark anniversary, the Spanish Riding School of Vienna will return to the UK in November 2016 for six exclusive new shows in London and Birmingham hosted by TV presenter and British Dressage Ambassador, Nicki Chapman. Tickets for the tour go on sale on Friday 9th October 2015 via www.livenation.co.uk\nwww.spanishridingschoollive.com\nwww.ticketmaster.co.uk\n\nSynonymous with the Austrian capital, the Spanish Riding School in Vienna is the only institution worldwide where classical equitation in the Renaissance tradition of the haute \u00e9cole is still cultivated. The School is the only place in the world where these classical equestrian skills have been preserved and practiced in their original form. Many years of training fuse horse and rider into an inseparable unit. Audiences are treated to an unforgettable experience by the precision of movement of the Lipizzan horses in perfect harmony with the music.\n\nThe UK shows are an impressive display classical equitation. Audiences will be mesmerised by the absolute balance and harmony achieved by these beautiful White Lipizzaner stallions and their regal riders.\n\nAll of their famous in-hand work and movements above the ground will be performed including the Capriole, an upward leap made without going forward and with a backward kick of the hind legs at the height of the leap, the Levade  in which the stallion puts its entire weight on its hind legs and raises its front legs no more than 45 degrees and Courbette where the horse raises its forehand off the ground, tucks up forelegs evenly, and then jumps forward in a series of \u201chops\"..\n\nNicki Chapman will be hosting the event and will be joined by special guests making this 2016 Spanish Riding School of Vienna Tour one of the most unique, exciting and captivating events of the coming year.\n\nNicki commented:\n\n \u201cThe Spanish Riding School of Vienna tours are rare and exceptional.  I\u2019m lucky enough to have been involved in the UK tours and the experience will  stay with me for the rest of my life! I\u2019ve witnessed first hand these graceful horses thrilling crowds with their astonishing combination of elegance and power. This is an extraordinary, once in a lifetime opportunity to witness these most celebrated, world renowned horses performing in the UK during their momentous 450th anniversary.\u201d\n\nThe Lipizzan lineage dates back to the 16th century, when it was developed exclusively by Habsburg monarchy. The breed is a cross between Spanish, Arabic and Berber horses. Estimates put the number of Lipizzaners worldwide at less than 3,000. Only 70 are trained to the demanding standards of the Spanish Riding School at any one time.The institution has been a favourite of royalty since it was set up. Our own Queen is a lifelong fan \u2013 and among the few women to have been allowed to ride one of the thoroughbreds.\n\nIncredibly moving, highly sophisticated and full of Viennese glamour the tickets for the 450th anniversary Spanish Riding School Tour are on sale from Friday 9th October 2015.", "location": {"city": "Wembley", "zip": "HA9 0AA", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": -0.28228865376669, "street": "Arena Square, Engineers Way", "latitude": 51.558176047907, "id": "105178062516"}}, "619732978196514": {"loc_name": "5th Annual Halloween House Party", "description": "SOCIAL ARCHITECTS PRESENT\n5TH ANNUAL HALLOWEEN HOUSE PARTY\n\nOCTOBER 29, 2016\n8:00PM - 2:00AM\n\nRENAISSANCE HOTEL\n999 NINTH ST NW \nWASHINGTON DC  20001\n\nSPECIAL GUEST DJ - TBA  \nGENERAL\nEARLY BIRD TICKETS $10 - ENDS 08.30.16  \nEARLY BIRD TICKETS $20 - 08.30.16 - 10.14.16 \nEARLY BIRD TICKETS $25 - 10.14.16 - 10.29.16\n\nVIP TICKETS - $65 - INCLUDES: \nINCLUDES VIP ADMITTANCE/AREA\nCOMPLIMENTARY HORS D' OEUVRES 9PM-11PM\nCOMPLIMENTARY PREMIUM OPEN BAR 9PM-11PM \n\nHOTEL ROOMS:\nTBD\nVIP TABLE/ BIRTHDAY PACKAGE\n10 GUESTS\n1 RESERVED VIP TABLE\n1 BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE OR TEN PREMIUM DRINK TICKETS\nSPECIAL BIRTHDAY ANNOUNCEMENTS BY DJ\n$400.00\n\n**COSTUME CONTEST - CASH PRIZES - 1ST, 2ND, 3RD PLACE\n**OLD SCHOOL HOUSE PARTY DANCE CONTEST: PRIZES WILL BE GIVEN TO EACH WINNER\nCABBAGE PATCH\nTHE SMURF\nTHE JERRY LEWIS\nPEPPER SEED\nRUNNING MAN\nROGER RABBIT\nTHE WOP\nKID & PLAY\nTHE CHARLIE BROWN\nPEE WEE HERMAN\nWE HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE\n\nAMENITIES INCLUDE:\nTWO ROOMS OF ENTERTAINMENT\nDJ & DANCING\nVALET PARKING\nDJ'S SPINNING OLD SCHOOL 80'S & 90'S HIP-HOP, HOUSE, REGGAE & MORE!\nFOR BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS PLEASE EMAIL TLFRASIER@AOL.COM OR CALL 202.450.0030\n\nMATURE PROFESSIONAL CLIENTELE ONLY\n\nATTIRE: COSTUMES PREFERRED BUT NOT MANDATORY\n              NO ATHLETIC WEAR PLEASE\n\nNO REFUNDS\nMUST BE 21 & OLDER - ID REQUIRED\n                 \nTHANK YOU \nTERRY FRASIER \nSOCIAL ARCHITECTS", "location": {"city": "Washington", "zip": "20001", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.0233994, "state": "DC", "street": "999 9th St NW", "latitude": 38.9016685, "id": "285602348140269"}}, "1782326581981846": {"loc_name": "The 2016 London Freshers Ball at Sway Holborn!", "description": "Buying a wristband saves you \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3!

Veganism offers a clear alternative to the current system for exploitation and death of animals. \n\nWe will march on Westminster in a wave of colour using all of our creative skills to create an animal rights march bigger, brighter, louder than the UK has ever witnessed. \n\nWe will evoke the spirit of the great marches of the past. We will walk in the footsteps of the Suffragettes, the trade unionists and anti-apartheid marches of yesteryear.  \n\nThis march will be historical, unmistakeable and powerful\u2026\n\nOur demands for politicians and business are simple:\n\nEND THE EXPLOITATION AND MURDER OF ANIMALS FOR HUMAN BENEFIT\n\n-In the UK we kill 8 billion animals a year\n-Globally we kill 56 billion animals a year\n-Animals are systematically exploited for dairy, leather and fur\n-Animals are the victim of horrific animal testing\n-Animal agriculture is responsible for at least 16% of global greenhouse gases\n-Animal agriculture is responsible for mass deforestation and environmental degradation\n\nWe have a chance to make history! We can create a better world for the animals, only if we take to the streets in our thousands will we be heard.\n\nThe police have been notified and the meeting point and route will be announced in the coming weeks. \n\nThis march is organised by creative activism collective SURGE>>>>>>> \nlike us on facebook: www.facebook.com/surgeactivism\n\nPlease invite others to and share this event.

With an incredible array of sounds emerging from his studio, whether it is under the Plex name or one of his aliases, every note, every drum hit, is perfectly formed to create that indescribable groove that unquestionably identifies a Maceo Plex track.\n\nSpeaking of grooves, Maceo\u2019s efforts this summer have grooved the whole of Europe, from curating and building his own eclectic party built from all corners of electronica, Mosaic (which will be coming to London on New Year\u2019s Day), to his 24 hours of sets all over the White Isle, to the future classics being released on his Ellum imprint, everywhere we look we see the master at work, which makes it even more exciting for us to host him for his first show since last New Year\u2019s Day in London.\n\nAfter hosting John Talabot, Roman Flugel, Kiasmos, Extrawelt and many more at Bankside Vaults for the last Avant Garde event, we reckon it\u2019s the ideal immense space for this headliner\u2019s immense talent.

Geb\u00fchren\n\nOzeanische Klanggischt umbraust unsere Ohren, V\u00f6gel zwitschern in Wipfeln, ein Wind weht Ger\u00e4usche heran und davon; eine Kirchenorgel f\u00fcllt gl\u00e4ubig brummend einen gewaltigen Raum; in der Gischt und unter dem Brummen k\u00fcndet eine junge, hoffnungsvoll melancholische Stimme davon, dass es mehr gibt als wir uns vorstellen m\u00f6gen: \u201eIch kann es sp\u00fcren / hinter den Dingen / unter der Struktur\u201c. Die Stimme k\u00fcndet von der vergehenden Zeit und dem verhei\u00dfungsvollen Schimmern des kommenden Tages \u2013 \u201emorgen alles anders / morgen alles neu\u201c \u2013 sie lobpreist das reine Werden und den endlosen Wandel, die Sch\u00f6nheit der unaufh\u00f6rlichen Transformation. Und so werdend und transformierend bewegt sich auch die Musik unter der singenden Stimme; sie bewegt sich unaufh\u00f6rlich voran und dreht sich wieder in sich zur\u00fcck, kreist und krei\u00dft: Scheinbar stehende T\u00f6ne beginnen allm\u00e4hlich nerv\u00f6s zu erzittern, um dann eine funkelnde Melodie freizulassen; aus klitzekleinen repetitiven Gitarrenfiguren entsteht ein episch sich sehnender Krach; p\u00e4laolithisches Keyboardpluckern und Spinettgeschepper verbinden sich zu einem fabelhaft flirrenden Fehlfarbengem\u00e4lde.\n\nSo klingt die zeitlos gegenw\u00e4rtigste Musik, die wir derzeit besitzen: Es ist die Musik von Max Rieger. Mit seiner Gruppe Die Nerven spielt der Universalgelehrte aus Stuttgart den schroffsten und tollsten, wundesten und z\u00e4rtlichsten Noiserock des Landes; das Album FUN von 2014 ist ohne Frage ein Hauptwerk der deutschsprachigen Popmusik in diesem Jahrzehnt. Unter dem Namen All diese Gewalt hat Max Rieger nun sein zweites Soloalbum aufgenommen: Es hei\u00dft Welt in Klammern und ist ein dunkelbunt funkelnder Strau\u00df aus Ger\u00e4uschen, Drones, Vogelgezwitscher und wundervollen Melodien, die sich sogleich im Geh\u00f6r zu verhaken beginnen. Es geht um das Wegfliegen und Loslassenk\u00f6nnen, um Angst vor der Leichtigkeit und vor dem Verlust, aber auch um das Vertrauen in die heilenden Kr\u00e4fte der Ambivalenz. Jeder Traum eine Falle hei\u00dft das dritte St\u00fcck \u2013 aber in die Traumfallen, die Max Rieger f\u00fcr uns aufgestellt hat, tapsen wir nur allzu gerne hinein.\n\nAll diese Gewalt bewegt sich entlang der musikalischen Linien, die man auch von Die Nerven kennt. Doch sind die schroffen Kl\u00e4nge und die splittrigen Abstraktionen des Postpunk in weiche, flie\u00dfende Formen geflochten; nicht der Break, der \u00fcberraschende Wechsel ist hier das Leitmotiv der Dramaturgie, sondern der unmerklich organische Wandel, an dessen Ende man sich fragt, wie man eigentlich in diesen Klang, in diese musikalische Sph\u00e4re gelangen konnte. Die Songs sind eigentlich keine Songs, sondern Kr\u00e4ftefelder \u2013 Geflechte aus Intensit\u00e4ten, flirrende Muster: Klangbilder, die erst nachtr\u00e4glich sich in die Zeit zu erstrecken begonnen haben.\n\nDarin spiegelt sich auch der Kontrast zu Max Riegers Musik mit Die Nerven. Deren Songs entstehen aus der hitzig-gemeinsamen Arbeit einer Band. Bei All diese Gewalt macht Rieger alles allein, mit k\u00fchler Ruhe und doch einem enormen Output; er schichtet Ideen und Sounds \u00fcbereinander und l\u00e4sst die Lieder in ihrer eigenen Geschwindigkeit wachsen. \u00dcber 160 Songs sind den letzten Jahren auf diese Weise entstanden, zwischen 2013 und Anfang 2016, in den Leerr\u00e4umen zwischen Studioaufnahmen und Tourneen mit Die Nerven. Zehn von ihnen sind nun auf Welt in Klammern zu h\u00f6ren. Zwei- bis dreihundert Spuren finden sich in jedem St\u00fcck, jede von ihnen hat Max Rieger selbst eingespielt. Das Hauptarbeitsger\u00e4t war der Laptop in seinem Heimstudio; es sind aber auch Gitarre und Schlagzeug zu h\u00f6ren und viele Field Recordings: murmelnde Menschen, Tierstimmen, die Kl\u00e4nge von St\u00e4dten, schlie\u00dflich kleine minimalistische Muster, die sich rhythmisch langsam verschieben wie in der Musik von Steve Reich, den Rieger als zentrale Inspirationsquelle benennt.\n\nUnd vor allem h\u00f6rt man Drones: tiefe, hohe, brummende, fiepende, vibrierende, mit sich selber r\u00fcckkoppelnde Sounds. F\u00fcr jedes einzelne St\u00fcck, sagt Rieger, hat er sich einen Drone zum Ausgangspunkt genommen, einen schwebenden, stehenden, verwehenden Ton. Dann hat er die Melodien dort hinein verflochten und die Rhythmen und schlie\u00dflich die Texte. Um den \u201eKlang an sich\u201c, sagt Max Rieger, sei es ihm ebenso gegangen wie darum, \u201ePopsongs zu erschaffen, die keine W\u00fcnsche mehr \u00fcbrig lassen \u2013 aber das klappt in der Regel ja doch nicht\u201c. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnte man sagen, dass Welt in Klammern ein avantgardistisches Drone-Album ist, das sich als unmittelbar eing\u00e4ngiges Popalbum tarnt. Oder umgekehrt: Jedenfalls ist dies die sch\u00f6nste und bewegendste, bestrickendste und kl\u00fcgste Platte, die man in diesem Jahr zu h\u00f6ren bekommen wird. Ich w\u00fcsste beim besten Willen nicht, welcher Wunsch da noch \u00fcbrig bliebe.\n\nVeranstaltungsort: Hotel Shanghai\nVeranstalter: Weststadthalle Essen", "location": {"city": "Essen", "zip": "45127", "country": "Germany", "longitude": 7.01744, "street": "Steelerstr. 33", "latitude": 51.4560699, "id": "70952716468"}}, "174683836274366": {"loc_name": "Late at the Fitzwilliam", "description": "Free special after hours opening of the Museum.

Centuries of despotism have rendered this form bereft of content. In Tarabnameh, a play with a cast of thirty-seven actors, this ancient comic genre keeps its joyous ambiance but takes on new form and meaning, underscoring the possibilities of once forgotten traditions becoming rich, robust, and lively modern forms of theater.\n\nThis play is written and directed acclaimed Iranian playwright Bahram Beyzaie. The play is being performed in Persian. Only part 2 of this play is being performed. A written account of part 1 by Mr. Beyzaie will be available at Iranian-studies.stanford.edu shortly.\n\nWe are very pleased to announce that the acclaimed actress Shabnam Tolouei will be joining the cast of Tarabnameh for part 2!\n\nPlease note the run time for this performance is approximately 5 \u00bd hours which includes a 15 and a 30-minute intermission.

Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt\u2019s fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.", "location": {"city": "Cambridge", "zip": "CB2 3AR", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": 0.12368685220838, "street": "38 - 39 St Andrews St.", "latitude": 52.202938109553, "id": "115354400706"}}, "699612313524134": {"loc_name": "The Chemical Brothers LIVE at London Eventim Apollo, England", "description": "SOLD OUT!  \n2ND SHOW ADDED SUN 11TH! \n\nW/ DJ JAMES HOLROYD\n\nDoors open time: 19:00\nVenue Phone Number 020 8563 3800\nWebsite: gigsandtours.com \nTicket Phone Number: 0844 811 0051\nAges: 14+ \nFacebook: facebook.com/gigsandtours\nTwitter: @Gigsandtours", "location": {"city": "London", "zip": "W6 9", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": -0.22436493634081, "street": "45 Queen Caroline Street", "latitude": 51.4908921, "id": "112183489340"}}, "819949404777724": {"loc_name": "DreamTrips - Beijing, China", "description": "About Your Trip\nSee what being a DreamTrips Member is all about on this Welcome DreamTrip!

A horn heavy and funk driven live show combines original material with medleys of classic hip hop and bboy breaks, which has lead the band to be a firm favourite at festivals and clubs throughout the UK.\n\nEarlier in their career they built a loyal fan base supporting many of the world\u2019s finest hip hop acts including Chali 2na, Souls Of Mischief, Akil the MC and The Sugarhill Gang. Their reputation as a high quality live act resulted in two invitations to perform at the BBC\u2019s legendary Maida Vale Studios in London. 2014 saw the band take their brand of funk, jazz and reggae influenced hip hop to France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Czech Republic and Croatia, with key slots at prestigious festivals such as Soundwave, Outlook and Fusion.\n\n\nwww.themouseoutfit.com\nwww.facebook.com/themouseoutfit\nhttps://twitter.com/themouseoutfit\nhttps://soundcloud.com/themouseoutfit\n\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nTICKETS:\n\nBOOKING ONLINE: www.junction.co.uk/the-mouse-outfit\n\nBOOKING IN PERSON:\nYou can buy or collect your tickets prior to the event from:\n\nTHE JUNCTION BOX OFFICE: Cambridge Leisure Park, Clifton Way, Cambridge, CB1 7GX.\n\nBOOKING BY PHONE:\nPlease call 01223 511 511\n\n(You must bring the card on which the tickets were purchased when you collect your tickets)\n\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\nProudly presented by:\nEdwartainments\nwww.edwartainments.com\nCambridge Junction\nwww.junction.co.uk", "location": {"city": "Cambridge", "zip": "CB1 7GX", "country": "United Kingdom", "longitude": 0.13636323916816, "street": "Cambridge Leisure park, Clifton Way", "latitude": 52.190539592503, "id": "109367642450438"}}, "138906816533401": {"loc_name": "C.C.

One of the UK's finest, most respected, innovative and forward thinking home-grown electronic music producers. He is the Godfather of Acid House and pioneered the style which became drum'n'bass with his visions, his stylistic versatility and open mindedness having a huge influence on the development of global dance culture.\n\nGerardo Delgado and Quinn Whalley's music as Paranoid London reveres a certain tradition. They use vintage hardware, and most of their records are pressed on 180g vinyl with simple artwork and minimal fuss. Their sound has always been inspired by the old school. They sold more of their debut album than anyone else without any press, reviews or promotional copies given away. They destroyed every party/festival they playe including Panorama Bar, Sonar By Night, Dekmantel & the Fabric 16th birthday party. This is the real deal: dirty, repetitive music for DJ's & dancers.\n\n\nTickets - $10 first release / $15 second release / $20 at the door\n\nListen \nhttps://soundcloud.com/paranoid-london\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aguycalledgerald\nhttps://soundcloud.com/capriccio\nhttps://soundcloud.com/i-t-a-l", "location": {"city": "Brooklyn", "zip": "11222", "country": "United States", "longitude": -73.952888148623, "state": "NY", "street": "98 Meserole Ave", "latitude": 40.726926313912, "id": "463273243814163"}}, "1346551622025111": {"loc_name": "Bus Trip - New York City at Christmas Time", "description": "The holiday decorations, the shows, the shopping...it's a great time of the year to visit New York City and take in the sights!
