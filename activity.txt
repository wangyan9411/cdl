I will prove that under proper absorption rates, a random walk starting from a set S of low conductance will be mostly absorbed in S. Moreover, the absorption probabilities vary slowly inside S, while dropping sharply outside. The partially absorbing process provides new insights into many popular graph models, generates new models, and opens the door for model comparison and selection.

At that time linear algebra was studied by a small group of math majors and the equivalent course to Computational Science and Engineering never saw a computer. This had to change — without losing the mathematical content!\nIn this talk I will share my experience in redesigning these courses, writing new textbooks, getting the courses online and making it available to MIT students and to the world.\nThe inverse of a banded matrix A has a special form with low rank submatrices except at the main diagonal. That form comes directly from the \"Nullity Theorem.\" Then the inverse of that matrix A-1 is the original A ----- which can be found by a remarkable \\local\" inverse formula. This formula uses only the banded part of A-1 and it oers a very fast algorithm to produce A.\nThat fast algorithm has a potentially valuable application. Start now with a banded matrix B. (Possibly B is the positive denite beginning of a covariance matrix C ----- but covariances outside the band are unknown or too expensive to compute). It is a poor idea to assume that those unknown covariances are zero. Much better to complete B to C by a rule of maximum entropy ----- for Gaussians this rule means maximum determinant. \nAs statisticians and also linear algebraists discovered, the optimally completed matrix C is the inverse of a banded matrix. Best of all, the matrix actually needed in computations is that banded C-1 (which is not B !). And C-1 comes quickly and eciently from the local inverse formula.\nA very special subset of banded matrices contains those whose inverses are also banded. These arise in studying orthogonal polynomials and also in wavelet theory  — the wavelet transform and its inverse are both banded ( = FIR lters). We describe a factorization for all banded matrices that have banded inverses.","speaker":{"name":"Gilbert Strang","aid":"544104b5dabfae7d84bd371e","affiliation":"Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 77 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA","bio":"Gilbert Strang is an American mathematician, with contributions to finite element theory, the calculus of variations, wavelet analysis and linear algebra.

The progress of laser cooling of the rare earth fermions 161Dy and 163Dy has opened up a whole new opportunity to study novel itinerant fermion systems characterized by magnetic dipolar interactions, which are qualitatively different from solid-state electron systems. Magnetic dipole moments are intrinsically quantum operators proportional to the hyperfine-spin. In unpolarized systems, magnetic dipolar interactions are isotropic but exhibit the spin-orbit coupled nature, which brings important consequences to the many-body physics. As a starting point, we use spin-1/2 fermions as a prototype model which preserves the spin-orbit coupled feature of the magnetic dipolar interaction.\n\nMagnetic dipolar interaction leads to a robust mechanism for the p-wave spin triplet pairing, which is different from the usual spin fluctuation mechanism in 3He. Furthermore, a novel pairing symmetry appears, which, to our knowledge, has not been studied in condensed matter systems before. The spin and orbital angular momenta of Cooper pairs are coupled to form total angular momentum J = 1. This J-triplet pairing phase is different from both the spin-orbit coupled 3He-B phase whose J=0 and the spin-orbit decoupled 3He-A phase. It possesses nodal Bogoliubov quasi-particles which exhibit either time-reversal invariant Dirac type spectra or the time-reversal symmetry breaking Weyl type spectra.\n \nReferences:\n\n1) YL, C.

For pairing between two Fermi surfaces carrying opposite Chern numbers ±q, the pairing phases cannot be globally well-defined over the Fermi surface, which exhibit non-trivial Berry phase structure characterized by the monopole charge q. Consequently, it exhibits novel Cooper pairing with non-zero total vorticity over the Fermi surface. In the presence of rotational symmetry, the Cooper pairing symmetry cannot be classified by ordinary spherical harmonic functions but by monopole harmonic functions defined on the Fermi surface.\n\nReferences:\n\n1) YL, APS 2015 March Meeting Talk;\n2) YL, F.D.M.

Different from superconductors of which the BCS theory usually provides a controllable weak-coupling description, itinerant FM is intrinsically a strong-correlation phenomenon and needs non-perturbative study. On the other hand, most FM materials are orbitally active with prominent Hund’s coupling. However, Hund’s rule is local physics, which can only polarize electrons on the same site, and it is a longstanding problem under what conditions Hund’s coupling can lead to the global FM coherence.\n\nIn this talk, I will present non-perturbative studies on a class of 2D and 3D multi-orbital Hubbard models in which Hund’s coupling plays the essential role, including exact theorems proving itinerant FM ground states and high precision quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations on thermodynamic properties. These exact results set up stable phases of itinerant FM in a large region of electron densities. Hence, they serve as a reference point for further explorations and can be applied to a wide class of systems ranging from the transition-metal-oxide hetero-structure of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, and to the p-orbital band systems of ultra-cold fermions in optical lattices. Their connection to the 3D FM material in the SrRuO3 will also be discussed. The results provide helpful guidance for the searching of novel 2D and 3D itinerant FM materials.\n\nFurthermore, the magnetic phase transition is another long-standing problem in itinerant FM due to the lack of non-perturbative treatment on the strong magnetic fluctuations with electron itineracy. QMC simulations are ideal non-perturbative numeric methods. However, they usually suffer from the notorious sign problem for fermions.

To measure the internal flow of the diffuser and the impeller easily, air was used in this pump test. As a result of measuring pressure fluctuation, the rotating stall was observed in the vaned and vaneless diffuser. We clarified the generating mechanism and characteristics of the rotating stall in the diffuser and the difference between the unsteady flow fields in both diffusers. In case of the vaned diffuser, the number of rotating stall cells were 4 in the diffuser and the cell propagation speed ratio was about 5 percent of the impeller rotating speed. On the other hand, in case of the vaneless diffuser, the cell number was 2, and the propagation speed ratio was about 10 percent of that. These phenomena in both diffuser pumps were simulated by unsteady 2D and 3D CFD computations. By using these computations, the vortex at the trailing edge of the diffuser vanes blocked the flow and induced separate flow at the leading edge resulted in the rotating stall．This research indicated that these vortices induced the total pressure loss increasing. Also, the rotating stall was found not only in the diffuser but also in the impeller by the flow simulation of the vaneless diffuser. And it was confirmed that the vortices at the impeller trailing edge and leading edge in the stall cells cause the total pressure loss.","speaker":{"name":"宫川和芳","aid":"","affiliation":"日本早稻田大学","bio":"宫川和芳先生早年毕业于日本早稻田大学，获大阪大学工学博士学位。曾在日本三菱重工业株式会社供职长达二十多年，从事透平机械（压缩机、泵、抽水蓄能机组、螺旋桨等）相关技术研究，先后担任三菱重工技术本部研究员、主任研究员、主席研究员，长崎研究所副所长。在长期的实际工作中，积累了极其丰富的工程经验，在日本乃至世界透平机械工业领域享有盛誉。\n宫川和芳先生于2011年被早稻田大学作为特殊人才引进，现任早稻田大学基干理工学部机械科学航空学科教授，活跃在国际流体工程学界。","position":"Professor","img":""},"subtime":"2015-08-17T14:52:50Z","uid":"","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"55d1f59045ced108f9a0f0ce","type":0,"title":"Silicon IC Technology Innovations and Challenges","img":"","location":{"city":"","address":"理科楼三楼报告厅（C302）"},"time":{"from":"2015-08-31T02:00:00Z","to":"2015-08-31T03:00:00Z"},"abstract":"讨论半导体集成电路技术历年来主要的创新和挑战，目前该技术已接近成熟期，接下来可能的机会在哪里，将会提到一些成本和获利的问题。","speaker":{"name":"蒋尚义","aid":"","affiliation":"台积电（TSMC）资深研发副总裁","bio":"Dr. Shang-Yi Chiang is Senior Vice President of Research and Development at TSMC.

In this talk recent advances concerning a promising new route to well-defined\n1D and 2D materials within this size regime, termed “living crystallization-driven living\nself-assembly” (CDSA), will be described.

Living CDSA offers a versatile new route to\nmonodisperse cylindrical micelles and 2D platelets, block comicelles with segmented\nnon-equilibrium structures, and complex, hierarchical materials with controlled dimensions and a\nvariety of potential applications[1-3]\n.\nThe seeded growth approach characteristic of living CDSA can be regarded as a type of\n“living supramolecular polymerization” that is analogous to living covalent (e.g. anionic)\npolymerizations of molecular monomers. The process is performed under conditions that yield\nkinetically-trapped non-covalent assemblies in which potential dynamic behavior is switched off.\nSeeded growth approaches characteristic of living CDSA appear to be applicable to a wide range\nof other block copolymers with crystallizable blocks, including biod -conjugated\nmaterials, and also to molecular amphiphiles that form -stacked supramolecular polymeric\nassemblies.","speaker":{"name":"Ian Manners","aid":"","affiliation":"School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, UK","bio":"Ian was born in London, England in 1961 and, after completing his Ph.D., moved first to Germany and then the USA for postdoctoral work.

In this talk, I will present two recent developments on the emerging new phenomena in these 2D semiconductors. First, I will discuss the distinct symmetry properties of the monolayers that are probed by nonlinear optical spectroscopy. The prominent optical second-harmonic response reveals broken inversion symmetry in the monolayers and provides a convenient optical probe to determine their crystallographic orientation. The observed broken inversion symmetry has profound impact on the physical properties of monolayer TMDCs. In the second part of my talk, I will present experimental evidences for the valley contrast magnetic moments, which are allowed only in the absence of inversion symmetry. The valley contrast magnetic moments open up new mechanisms to control the valley degree of freedom. I will illustrate how to lift the valley degeneracy and how to create a valley polarization using magnetic field.

Such an accelerator-rich architecture presents a fundamental departure from the classical von Neumann architecture, which emphasizes efficient sharing of the executions of different instructions on a common pipeline, providing an elegant solution when the computing resource is scarce. In constrast, the accelerator-rich architecture features heterogeneity and customizaiton for energy efficiency, which is better suited for energy-constrained designs where the silicon resource is abundant.\nIn this talk, I shall first present an overview of our research on customized computing, from single-chip, to server node, and to data centers, with extensive use of composable accelerators and field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGAs), and highlight our successes in several application domains.

been significant interest in how to learn similarity from data. In this talk, we focus on exploring this topic by learning a distance metric.   We will first introduce how previous metric learning was conducted in the literature. We then detail two of our recent works, from a sparse and a robust perspective respectively.  We first talk about sparse metric learning (SML) in which we simultaneously learn both a good distance metric and a low-dimensional representation.  We propose a novel generalized sparse metric learning method (GSML) that offers a unified view for understanding many of the popular sparse metric learning algorithms including the sparse metric learning framework proposed, the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN), and the D-ranking vector machine (D-ranking VM). Moreover, GSML also establishes a close relationship with the pairwise support vector machine. Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of extending many current non-sparse metric learning models such as relevant vector machine (RCA) and a state-of-the-art method proposed into their sparse versions.  On the other hand, most existing distance metric learning methods assume perfect side information that is usually given in pairwise or triplet constraints. Instead, in many real-world applications, the constraints are derived from side information, such as users' implicit feedbacks and citations among articles. As a result, these constraints are usually noisy and contain uncertain information. We then aim to learn a distance metric from noisy constraints by robust optimization in a worst-case scenario, to which we refer as robust metric learning. We formulate the learning task initially as a combinatorial optimization problem, and show that it can be elegantly transformed to a convex programming problem. We present an efficient learning algorithm based on smooth optimization. We will present a series of experiments which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.","speaker":{"name":"Kaizhu Huang","affiliation":"Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University","bio":"Dr. Kaizhu Huang is currently an Associate Professor in Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and an Affiliated Full Professor at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

However, existing HLS techniques provide inadequate support for pipelining irregular loop nests that contain dynamic-bound inner loops, where unrolling is either very expensive or not even applicable. To overcome this major limitation, we propose ElasticFlow, a novel architectural synthesis approach capable of dynamically distributing inner loops to an array of loop processing units (LPUs) in a complexity-effective manner. These LPUs can be either specialized to execute an individual loop or shared amongst multiple inner loops for area reduction. We evaluate ElasticFlow using a variety of real-life applications and demonstrate significant performance improvements over a widely used commercial HLS tool for Xilinx FPGAs.","speaker":{"name":"Zhiru Zhang","aid":"540691c6dabfae44f0841bff","affiliation":"Cornell University and a member of the Computer Systems Laboratory","bio":"Dr. Zhiru Zhang is an assistant professor in the School of ECE at Cornell University and a member of the Computer Systems Laboratory.

Mobile terminals (MTs), equipped with multi-homing capabilities, can explore network cooperation to simultaneously aggregate the offered resources from different networks to support the same application and thus increase the data rate.  On the other hand, as the gap between the MT energy demand and battery capacity continues to increase, the MT operational time in between battery charging has become a significant factor in service quality. In this presentation, we introduce an energy management system for MTs to support a sustainable multi-homing video transmission, over the call duration, in a heterogeneous wireless access medium. Through statistical video quality guarantee, the MT can determine a target video quality lower bound for a target call duration. The target video quality lower bound captures the MT available energy at the beginning of the call, the time varying bandwidth availability and channel conditions at different radio interfaces, the target call duration, and the video packet characteristics in terms of distortion impact, delay deadlines, and video packet encoding statistics. The MT then adapts its energy consumption to support at least the target video quality lower bound during the call. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over two benchmarks, and some performance trade-offs.","speaker":{"name":"Weihua Zhuang","aid":"5484b4f5dabfae8a11fb2233","affiliation":"Broadband Communications Research (BBCR) Group  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Waterloo","bio":"Weihua Zhuang has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada, since 1993, where she is a Professor and a Tier I Canada Research Chair in Wireless Communication Networks.

Two fundamental obstacles exist: 1) mainstream indoor localization technologies rely on RF signatures that require extensive human efforts to measure and periodically re-calibrate; 2) service providers do not have floor plan data and have to go through effort intensive business negotiations to obtain them from various sources. This talk presents two projects targeting the two problems. In Sextant, we leverage environmental physical features that are stable over time thus eliminating the periodic calibration efforts. Users measure their relative locations to these features with smartphones to obtain their location. In Jigsaw, we gather image and inertial data from smartphone users, combine vision and mobile techniques to construct the floor plans with reasonable accuracy.  Together they hold the promise to ubiquitous coverage of indoor localization service for the whole planet.","speaker":{"name":"Fan Ye","affiliation":"the Computer Science Department of UCLA","bio":"Fan Ye received his Ph.D. from the Computer Science Department of UCLA.

Its revolutionary potential is now universally recognized. Data complexity, heterogeneity, scale, and timeliness make data analysis a clear bottleneck in many applications, due to the complexity of the patterns and lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms.\nAdvanced machine learning and data mining algorithms have been developed to address one or more challenges listed above. It is typical that the complexity of potential patterns may grow exponentially with respect to the data complexity, and so is the size of the pattern space. To avoid an exhaustive search through the pattern space, machine learning and data mining algorithms usually employ a greedy approach to search for a local optimum in the solution space, or use a branch-and-bound approach to seek optimal solutions, and consequently, are often implemented as iterative or recursive procedures. To improve efficiency, these algorithms often exploit the dependencies between potential patterns to maximize in-memory computation and/or leverage special hardware (such as GPU and FPGA) for acceleration.","speaker":{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Co-Director, Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi), University of California, Los Angeles","bio":"Wei Wang is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles and the director of the Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi).

The latter is fundamentally hindered by the physical size of mobile devices as dictated by its mobility nature. In this research, we propose to leverage the seemingly unlimited resources in cloud computing to extend the capability of mobile devices via application offloading. In particular, resource-hungry mobile applications are offloaded to a cloud platform in proximity.  The cloud platform provides a virtual machine, as a digital clone of the physical device, to execute dynamically-offloaded tasks.\nThe mobile app offloading approach pivots on two complementary technical contributions. First, previous research efforts have been focusing on exploring alternative mechanisms to implement application offloading, including Cloudlet, Cloud Clone and Weblet, etc. Second, it demands a unified decision-making framework to understand a fundamental trade-off between communication overhead and computation saving, in the presence of inherent system uncertainty (e.g., varying channel conditions, dynamic computing complexity, etc). \nIn this talk, we present a unified mathematical framework to determine whether it is beneficial to offload a mobile app to the cloud in proximity. We model the mobile workflow as a directed graph, whose vertices represent computing load of a specific module and edges represent data exchange between modules. A policy engine determines whether a vertex should be offloaded to the cloud for execution, by trading the computation cost on the mobile device over the communication overhead between the mobile device and the cloud. We formulate this decision-making challenge as a constrained optimization problem, with an objective to minimize a chosen cost metric (e.g., energy consumption) for either the mobile user or the mobile service provider, under the constraint of quality of service (QoS) requirements (e.g., delay deadline). Our analytical framework builds on solving a series of progressively-challenging sub-problems with an increasing complexity of the workflow graph, namely, graph of a single node, linear topology and directed acyclic graph. For each of these sub-problems, we have developed either closed-form solutions or efficient algorithms to provide operational guideline for optimal mobile app offloading. \nOur theoretic framework is further verified by two real system developments. In our group, we have developed a multi-screen cloud Social TV system (i.e., Yubigo), allowing video-streaming session to seamlessly migrate across different screens (e.g., TV, laptop and smartphone). It builds upon the clone-based model to offload the session management onto a dedicated service container in the cloud. Our research has also inspired an open-source cloud robotic framework (i.e., Rapyuta), which was developed by EPFL researcher by adopting our proposed clone-based model. Both projects have been spun off as start-up with public and/or private investment.","speaker":{"name":"Yonggang Wen","aid":"53f36e87dabfae4b349b896c","affiliation":"South China University of Technology(South China University of Technology,South China Univ. of Technol.),Guangzhou,China","bio":"Dr. Yonggang Wen is an associate professor with School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

Many believe the memory-wall problem can only be solved with new memory technologies that improve memory device hardware performance. In this talk, we introduce an architectural solution, the memory Sluice Gate Theory, for solving the memory-wall problem. The focus of Sluice Gate Theory is not on hardware peak performance, but the achieved memory stall time. Based on Sluice Gate Theory, a memory system is built to mask the performance gap between CPU and memory devices during the data transfer process. The C-AMAT model is used to calculate the data transfer request/supply ratio at each memory layer (sluice stage) dynamically, and a global control algorithm, named layered performance matching (LPM), is developed to match the data transfer at each memory layer and thus match the overall performance between the CPU and memory system. Data concurrency plays a vital role in the matching and transfer process. Experimental testing is conducted which confirm the theoretical findings, with a 150 times performance improvement and the elimination of memory delay impact in our case studies.

It was incredibly efficient, but too technical for the average person. As time went on, the ubiquitous Web search box trained us to focus on phrases, not command lines. But it still wasn’t natural -- we’ve adapted to language on algorithms’ terms, instead of the other way around. It doesn’t have to be this way. Machines should learn from us, work with us, and talk to us in a way that feels organic and natural. Now that there’s a keyboard in every pocket and a text message on every screen, we can have the efficiency of the command line with the ease of use of natural language. \nIn this talk, I will showcase how Operator is able to leverage machine learning and nature language processing to build a conversational command line experience for e-commerce. This includes technological inventions that aim to solve many of the most challenging problems in AI including intent understanding, context modeling and automatic question answering etc, as well as product innovations that integrate the knowledge of human expert and AI in a seamless way.","speaker":{"name":"​Shuang Yang","affiliation":"Operator Inc","bio":"Shuang Yang is the Chief Scientist and Head of Data Scientist at Operator Inc., where he leads the R&D in Machine Learning, Data Science and Business Intelligence.

networks, opportunistic resources with dynamic quality are often present for the users to exploit. As many user tasks are delay-tolerant, this favorably allows the network users to wait for and access the opportunistic resource at the time of its best quality. For such delay-tolerant and opportunistic resource sharing networks (DTORS-Networks), the resource accessing strategies in literature suffer from three limitations: Firstly, they mainly focused on single-user scenanos whereas the competition from other users is ignored. Secondly, the influence from the resource seller who may take actions to manipulate the resource sharing procedure is not considered. Thirdly, the impact of the actions from both the network users and the resource seller on the resource quality dynamics is not considered either. To overcome these limitations, a leader- follower controlled Markov stopping game (LF-C-MSG) is developed in this work. derived Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) strategy of the LF-C-MSG can be used to guide the behaviors of both the network users and the resource seller for better performance and resource utilization efficiency. Two exemplary applications of the proposed LF-CMSG are presented, along with corresponding numerical results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","speaker":{"name":"Huaiyu Dai","aid":"54895f19dabfae8a11fb44cd","affiliation":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering|North Carolina State University","bio":"Huaiyu Dai (M'03, SM'09) received the B.F and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ in 2002.

The major challenge for initial key establishment, is the lack of pre-shared secrets among personal devices that are deployed in an ad hoc manner. In addition, personal devices are likely to be constrained in hardware interfaces and computational resources. Existing techniques such as device pairing usually need auxiliary secure channels or user interfaces that may not be present, and require significant human effort.\nIn this talk, we take a different \"in-band\" approach to establish initial trust without prior secrets, which is done purely using the wireless channel and with little human support. The key idea is to assure message integrity protection and authentication by countering signal cancellation in the wireless channel. We first build Chorus, which is a novel primitive that simultaneously compares the equality of fixed-length authentication strings held by multiple wireless devices within constant time. Chorus is then used as a foundation to design scalable in-band group message authentication and key agreement protocols, which do not require any prior shared secret. We also systematically studied the theoretical limit of Signal cancellation attacks and defenses through a game-theoretic framework, and proposed c practical protocol to ensure the infeasibility of signal cancellation in the real-world.

In this study, we propose a novel “trajectory-based” mobile advertising strategy that leverages full information on consumers’ physical movement trajectories using granular behavioral information from different mobility dimensions. To analyze the effectiveness of this new trajectory-based advertising strategy, we design a large-scale randomized field experiment in a large shopping mall that involved 83,370 unique user responses for a 14-day period in June 2014. We find that trajectory-based mobile advertising can lead to higher redemption probability, faster redemption behavior, and higher transaction amount from customers compared to other baselines. It also facilitates higher revenues for the focal store as well as the overall shopping mall. However, trajectory-based ads become less effective in boosting the revenues of the shopping mall during the weekends and for those shoppers who like to explore across products. It suggests that highly targeted mobile advertising can have the inadvertent impact of reducing impulse purchase behavior by customers who are in an exploratory shopping stage. The effect of trajectory-based advertising comes not only from improvements in the efficiency of customers’ current shopping process, but also from its ability to nudge customers towards changing their future shopping patterns and generate additional revenues. Finally, trajectory-based mobile advertising is especially effective in influencing high-income consumers. On a broader note, our work can be viewed as a first step towards studying the large-scale, fine-grained digital trace of individual physical behavior, and how it can be used to predict and market to individual anticipated future behavior.","speaker":{"name":"Siyuan Liu","affiliation":"Smeal College of Business,Pennsylvania State University","bio":"Siyuan Liu is Assistant Professor at Smeal College of Business, Pennsylvania State University.

First, disease gene search engine with evidence sentences (DigSee, ver. all diseases) is introduced. Biological events such as gene expression, regulation, phosphorylation, localization, and protein catabolism play important roles in the development of diseases. Understanding the association between diseases and genes can be enhanced with the identification of involved biological events in this association. Although biological knowledge has been accumulated in several databases and can be accessed through the Web, there is no specialized Web tool yet allowing for a query into the relationship among diseases, genes, and biological events. For this task, we developed DigSee to search Medline abstracts for evidence sentences describing that \"genes\" are involved in the development of \"disease\" through \"biological events.\" The components include crawling from PubMed, gene symbol extraction, gene normalization, and event extraction. Second, a computational approach to recommend herbs for treating diseases is introduced. We recently developed a novel search engine, HerDing, focused on retrieving candidate herb-related information with user search terms (a list of genes, a disease name, a chemical name or an herb name). Our approach considers properties of herb that contain multiple chemicals, resulting in targeting multiple genes. Hence, HerDing recommends herbs to treat diseases based on disease-related genes.","speaker":{"name":"Hyunju Lee","aid":"53f78f45dabfae8faa498ca3","affiliation":"Department of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju 500-712, Republic of Korea","bio":"Prof. Hyunju Lee received her BS from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (1997), MS from the Seoul National University, South Korea (1999) and PhD from the University of Southern California, USA (2006) all in Computer Science and Technology.

This has included using programmable accelerators, such as GPUs. It has also included increasing use of dedicated accelerators. Unfortunately, while this improves performance it sacrifices generality. More specifically, the time, dificulty and cost of special purpose design preclude dedicated logic from serving as a viable avenue for application innovation.\nThere recently has been interest in addressing this dilemma between providing programmability and higher performance via an interesting middle ground between fully general-purpose computing and dedicated logic. In specific, spatial computing uses arrays of small programmable processing elements (PIES) that operate in dataflow fashion to provide a very efficient execution engine. \nIn this talk. we will also describe a specific architecture that uses the twin ideas of triggered instructions and latency-insensitive channels to create an efficient control and communication environment for a spatial processor. Our analysis shows that a spatial accelerator using triggered instructions can achieve over 8X greater area-normalized performance than a traditional general-purpose processor.\n主办：清华微电子所","speaker":{"name":"Joel S.

The IoT wireless sensor nodes need to be maintenance free and operate continuously, which will have to rely on energy harvesting for power. In this talk, we propose online discrete rate and power adaption policies for an energy harvesting communication of IoT wireless sensor nodes. The receiver periodically sends 1-bit feedback by comparing the channel power gain with a predetermined threshold. The transmitter correspondingly adjusts QAM level and transmission power based on the 1-bit feedback and the available battery energy. To determine the optimal channel threshold, adaptive M-QAM level and corresponding power allocation, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize the throughput within a finite horizon. We further propose an efficient but suboptimal discrete rate and power policy. Our results show that the performance loss is negligible for the simple M-QAM adaption of the suboptimal policy that is attributed to the optimal choice of channel threshold.","speaker":{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":"The University of New South Wales","bio":"Dr. Wei Zhang (F’15) received the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2005.

Existing methods are either only suitable for small scale systematic synthesis. This motivates our research aiming at a scalable, correct- by-construction formal design methodology for distributed cooperative systems. Our basic idea is to decompose the team mission into individual subtasks such that the design can be reduced to local synthesis problems for individual robots, and then solving these local synthesis problems by composing predesigned and verified reactive motion/action primitives of robots. The developed theory will enable robots in the team to cooperatively learn their individual roles in a mission, and then automatically synthesize local task and mission plans to fulfill their subtasks. A salient feature of the proposed method lies on its ability to handle environmental uncertainties and un-modeled dynamics. In addition, the design is on-line and reactive enabling the robot team to adapt to changing environments and dynamic tasking.","speaker":{"name":"Hai Lin","aid":"54483354dabfae87b7de51a9","affiliation":"EE .

In this talk, we will focus on two mining tasks, i.e., (1) content-based recommendation and (2) anomaly detection in heterogeneous categorical events, and introduce (1) how to represent nodes when different types of nodes and links are involved; and (2) how heterogeneous links play different roles in these tasks.

In this talk, I will first overview a lab-scale 100-server datacenter cluster we built and some research works we conducted based on it. Then, I will pick one of them called PIAS, Practical Information-Agnostic flow Scheduling, and discuss the details.\n\nPIAS was motivated by the observation that many prior datacenter flow scheduling schemes minimize flow completion times (FCT) assuming prior knowledge of flows and custom switch functions. This makes them exciting in performance, but hard to use in practice. By PIAS, we present a scheme to minimize FCT with no prior knowledge and existing commodity switch functions. At its heart, PIAS leverages multiple priority queues available in existing commodity switches to implement a Multiple Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ), in which a PIAS flow is gradually demoted from higher-priority queues to lower-priority queues based on the amount of bytes it has sent. Consequently, short flows are likely to be completed in the first few high-priority queues and thus be prioritized over long flows in general, which enables PIAS to emulate SJF without knowing flow sizes in advance. PIAS is readily implementable with commodity switches and backward compatible with legacy TCP/IP stacks. And we have shown its superior performance through both testbed experiments and ns2 simulations.

However, the SPS with valley-polarization remains elusive and the tunability of magneto-optical transition frequency and emission/absorption intensity is restricted, in spite of being highly in demand for valleytronic applications. Here we report a new class of SPSs based on carriers spatially localized in two-dimensional monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide quantum dots (QDs). We demonstrate that the photons are absorbed (or emitted) in the QDs with distinct energy but definite valley-polarization. The spin-coupled valley-polarization is invariant under either spatial or magnetic quantum quantization. However, the magneto-optical absorption peaks undergo a blue shift as the quantization is enhanced. Moreover, the absorption spectrum pattern changes considerably with a variation of Fermi energy. This together with the controllability of absorption spectrum by spatial and magnetic quantizations, offers the possibility of tuning the magneto-optical properties at will, subject to the robust spin-coupled valley polarization. \nProf. Qu is also going to present a theory to describe the momentum-dependent exciton spectrum of monolayer molybdenum disulfide. They find that although monolayer MoS2 is a direct-gap semiconductor when classified by its quasiparticle band structure it may well be an indirect gap material when classified by its excitation spectra. They speculate on the role of this property in luminescence characteristics.

Specifically, we first derive the rates that are possible through minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation and three linear receivers: maximum ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF), and MMSE. Based on the derived rates, we quantify the amount of energy savings that are possible through increased number of base-station antennas or increased coherence interval. We also analyze achievable total degrees of freedom (DoF) of such a system without assuming channel state information at the receiver, which is shown to be the same as that of a point-to-point MIMO channel. Linear receiver is sufficient to achieve total DoF when the number of users is less than the number of antennas. Otherwise, nonlinear processing is necessary to achieve the full degrees of freedom. Finally, the training period and optimal training energy allocation under the average and peak power constraints are optimized jointly to maximize the achievable sum rate when either MRC or ZF receiver is adopted at the receiver.","speaker":{"name":"zhengdao wang","aid":"53f84c61dabfae90ec15b02a","affiliation":"Beijing Jiaotong Daxue(Beijing Jiaotong University,Northern Jiaotong University),Beijing,China","bio":"Zhengdao Wang received his Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 1996, the M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Virginia in 1999, and Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Minnesota in 2002.

However, to operate at higher efficiencies, the bridges must operate with Zero-Voltage-Switching (ZVS) over as wide an operating range as possible. The conventional approach to determine ZVS operation uses time domain analysis with ideal AC coupling inductances, which only approximately identifies the ZVS boundaries. This seminar now presents a new approach using harmonic decomposition of the bridge switching patterns, which gives an explicit theoretical solution under all operating conditions, while also accommodating more complex AC coupling structures, practical impedance non-idealities, and the switching impact of dead-time and device capacitance. The methodology is confirmed by matching analytical predictions with experimental results for selected DAB systems.","speaker":{"name":"Grahame Holmes","aid":"53f38d5adabfae4b34a3f040","affiliation":"Electrical and Computer Engineering RMIT University","bio":"For 26 year he was a faculty member at MonashUniversity, working in the area of Power Electronics, where he established the Power Electronics Research Group to support graduate students and research engineers working together on a mixture of theoretical and practical R&D projects.

When you randomly take a picture with your phone on the street, you can often find some highly correlated images in the Internet that were taken at the same location at different viewpoints and angles, focal lengths, and illuminations. In this talk, I will introduce our new researches on Cloud images. In compression of Cloud images, we analyze the correlation of images and organize them as pseudo image sequences. Our experimental results show that the size compressing them as sequences is only one-tenth of that compressing them one by one. In compression using Cloud images, we no longer compress images pixel by pixel and instead tried to describe images and reconstruct them from a large-scale image database via the descriptions. The proposed scheme can achieve thousands to one compression ratio with good visual quality. In Cloud-based image processing, we show amazed results on super-resolution and denoising by using external correlation.

We consider a type of distribution-uncertainty regressions that contains endogenous variable regression and semiparametric regression as its special cases. For such models, however, classical estimating function does involve infinitely many nuisance parameters caused by the uncertain distributions. Consequently, the parameters of interest cannot be consistently estimated and the corresponding prediction is imprecise, even aimless. In this paper, cross-sample and semiparametric techniques, together with a hidden-constant function, are proposed for dealing with the infinitely many nuisance parameters. The resultant estimating function only contains the parameters of interest, and the estimators of them are always consistent and normally distributed with standard convergence rate. Moreover, the newly proposed methodologies can avoid the use of instrumental variable or nonparametric estimation even if actually the model under study contains endogenous variables or nonparametric components. On the other hand, the methodologies for numerical computation are simple, and the corresponding computation procedures are somewhat similar to those for the distribution-certainty models. The main difference from the classical regression analysis is that the estimation efficiency is related to the level of distribution-uncertainty.","speaker":{"name":"Lu Lin","aid":"5406dc06dabfae92b4225b5c","affiliation":"School of Mathematics, Shandong University","bio":"林路，山东大学齐鲁证券金融研究院教授、博士生导师、副院长；在南开大学获得博士学位后,先在南开大学任教，然后到山东大学任教至今；在高维统计、非参数和半参数统计、稳健统计以及金融统计等方面，取得许多重要的研究成果，在国际统计学和机器学习顶级刊物Annals of Statistics、Journal of Machine Learning Research和重要期刊发表研究论文70余篇；是国家973项目、国家创新群体和教育部创新团队的核心成员，教育部应用统计专业硕士教育指导委员会成员，山东省应用统计学会副会长，山东省政府参事；主持过多项国家自然科学基金课题、博士点专项基金课题、山东省自然科学基金重点项目等。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/766/618/113/5406dc06dabfae92b4225b5c.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-16T07:16:49Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57987af29ed5db021a7513f3","type":0,"title":"The activation and conversion of C-H bond in methane over nanocatalysts","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"安徽大学磬苑校区理工H楼报告厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-11T02:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-11T04:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学化工学院","school":"安徽大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"祝艳","affiliation":"中国科学院","bio":"祝艳，中国科学院上海高等研究院研究员, 上海科技大学特聘教授。2007年南京大学获博士学位，2007-2008年日本庆应义塾大学特别助理研究员，2008-2011年美国卡内基梅隆大学博士后。2011年起中国科学院上海高等研究院工作，入选中国科学院“百人计划”, 上海市“浦江人才”计划，上海市青年联合会委员, 中国青年科技工作者协会会员,国家国际科技合作专家库专家，中国专利审查技术专家库专家，上海市浦东新区科技发展基金专家, 上海市科技奖励评审专家.一直从事纳米材料的制备和催化性能的研究，至今已发表SCI论文50余篇，发明专利15项，主持2项人才项目，3项国际合作项目，2项国家项目。","position":"博士生导师","img":""},"subtime":"2016-07-27T09:12:18Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57987af49ed5db021a7513f4","type":0,"title":"Tuning the Properties of Metal-Organic Frameworks – From Interior to Exterior","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"安徽大学磬苑校区理工H楼报告厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-11T01:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-11T03:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学化工学院","school":"安徽大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"李涛","affiliation":"上海科技大学","bio":"李涛，上海科技大学物质科学与技术学院助理教授/研究员/博导。李涛博士2008年于复旦大学获得学士学位，2013年在美国匹兹堡大学获得无机化学博士学位。2014至2015年在美国加州大学伯克利分校材料科学与工程系从事博士后研究工作。2015年12月起正式加入上海科技大学物质科学与技术学院任助理教授/博士生导师。李涛博士的研究工作主要围绕金属有机骨架材料（MOFs）的设计与改性、基于MOFs的混合基质气体分离膜的制备以及金属纳米簇的结构解析。主要工作在Nature Materials, PNAS, JACS, Angew.

All known pesudo-planar functions are quadratic  and hence they give presemifields. In this paper, a new approach to constructing quadratic pseudo-planar functions is given. Then five explicit families of pseudo-planar functions are constructed, one of which is a binomial, two of which are trinomials, and the other two are quadrinomials. All known pesudo-planar functions  are revisited, some of which are generalized. These functions not only lead to projective planes, relative difference sets and presemifields,  but also give optimal codebooks meeting the Levenstein bound, complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and good compressed sensing matrices.","speaker":{"name":"longjiang qu","aid":"53f4709fdabfaee2a1dd71a3","affiliation":"College of Science,National University of Defense Technology,Changsha ,China","bio":"屈龙江，男，河南新县人，1980年11月生，2002年、2007年在国防科技大学理学院数学与系统科学系分别获理学学士学位和博士学位，后留校任教。现为该系教授，国家自然科学基金通讯评议专家，美国Math Review评论员，IEEE 会员，中国密码学会会员，入选教育部新世纪人才计划和国防科技大学首届青年拔尖人才计划。从事编码密码理论及其应用研究，在密码函数的安全性指标分析、对称密码算法安全性分析等方面取得一系列研究成果，在《IEEE Trans. on Inform.

It is a daunting task to efficiently organize such an ultra-large KV store to support fast access. Current KV storage systems have one or more of the following inadequacies：：: (1) very high data write amplifications, (2) large index set, and (3) dramatic degradation of read performance with overspill index out of memory.\nTo address the issue, we propose LSM-trie, a KV storage system substantially reduce metadata for locating KV items, reduces write amplification by an order of magnitude,，and needs only two disk accesses with each KV read even when only less than 10% of metadata (Bloom filters) can bo held in memory. To this end, LSM-trie constructs a trie,or a prefix tree, that stores data in a hierarchical structure and keeps re-organizing them using a compaction method much more efficient than that, adopted for LSM-tree. Our experiments show t.hat. LSM-trie ⑶n improve write and read throughput of LevelDB，,a state-of-the-art KV system, by up to 20 times and up to 10 times, respectively.","speaker":{"name":"Song Jiang","aid":"54409d20dabfae7f9b345cb4","affiliation":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Wayne State University","bio":"Dr. Song Jiang is currently an associate professor of the ECE department at Wayne State University.

In contrast to conventional trajectory similarity search by spatial distance only, PTM takes into account the significance of each sample point in a query trajectory. A PTM query takes a trajectory with user specified weights for each sample point in the trajectory as its argument. It returns the trajectory in an argument data set with the highest similarity to the query trajectory. This type of query may bring significant benefits to users in many popular applications such as route planning, carpooling, friend recommendation, traffic analysis, urban computing, and location based services in general. To compute the PTM query efficiently, a novel two-phase search algorithm is proposed that carefully selects a set of expansion centers from the query trajectory and exploits upper and lower bounds to prune the search space in the spatial and temporal domains. An efficiency study reveals that the algorithm explores the minimum search in the spatial and temporal domains. Second, a heuristic search strategy based on priority ranking is developed to schedule the multiple so-called expansion centers effectively, which can further prune the search space and enhance the query efficiency. The performance of the PTM query is studied in extensive experiments based on real and synthetic trajectory data.\n","speaker":{"name":"shuo shang","aid":"53f43a34dabfaefedbaec247","affiliation":"Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Denmark","bio":"商烁.博士，中国石油大学（北京）计算机科学系教授t中国人民大学数据工程与知识工程教育部重点实验室客座教授，大数据管理与分析方法研宄北京市里点实验室主任助理、兼职教授，北京市科技新星、北京市优秀人才，现任中国计算机学会数据库专委会委员，中国地理信息产业协 会理论与方法专委会委员，他于2008年在北京大学获得学士学位，2012年在澳大利亚昆士兰大 学获得博士学位。他长期从事数据库、海世时空数据管理与分析方向的研宂，旨在为企业和个人 应用提供海量数据管理、整合和分析的商效解决方案。他在数据库领域知名的国际期刊和会议上 发表高水平学术论文30余篇，其中CCF A类论文10余篇。他钱担任2013国际数据工程会议 (ICDE)移动对象分会场主席，DASFAA 2015、2016程序委员会委及VLDB J、TKDE、ACM TSAS、ACM TIST、IEEE TITS、KAIS、DKE、WWW J、JCST、IEICE Transactions 等多个国际著名期刊审稿人。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/1856/774/1697/53f43a34dabfaefedbaec247.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-05T07:29:39Z","uid":"566f891645ce0bb16f69c2e0","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a19e4c9ed5dbc2a8c08682","type":0,"title":"DeeplD: Deep Learning for Face Recognition","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"中国科技大学西区电二楼208会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-19T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-19T04:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"计算机科学与技术学院","school":"中国科学技术大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"In this talk, I will present our works on deep learning for face recognition. With a novel deep model and a moderate training set with 400,000 face images, 99.47% accuracy has been achieved on LFW. the most challenging and extensively studied face recognition dataset. Deep learning provides a powerful tool to separate intra-personal and inter-personal variations, whose distributions are complex and highly nonlineai% through hierarchical feature transforms. It is essential to learn effective face representations by using two supervisory  signals simultaneously, i.e. the face identification and verification signals. Some people understand the success of deep learning as using a complex model with many parameters to fit a dataset. To clarify such misunderstanding, we further investigate face recognition process in deep nets, what information is encoded in neurons, and how robust they are to data corruptions. We discovered several interesting properties of deep nets, including sparseness, selectiveness and robustness.\nIn Multi-View Perception, a hybrid deep model is proposed to simultaneously accomplish the tasks of face recognition, pose estimation, and face reconstruction. It employs deterministic and random neurons to encode identity and pose information respectively. Given a face image taken in an arbitrary view, it can untangle the identity and view features, and in the meanwhile the full spectrum of multi-view images of the same identity can be reconstructed. It is also capable to interpolate and predict images under viewpoints that are unobserved in the training data.","speaker":{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","aid":"5608bdc145cedb3396d59370","affiliation":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","bio":"Xiaogang Wang received his Bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science from the Special Class of Gifted Young at the University of Science and Technology of China, MPhil. degree in Information Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and PhD degree in Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The core part of the scheme includes a set of knot selection rules that define local configurations of a triangulation called the directed-one-ring-cycle (D1RC) configurations and the definition of bivariate splines over a D1RC configuration. The new bivariate splines are new non-tensor-product splines and possess many nice properties of a univariate B-spline. Using these splines, we take an input triangular mesh as a control mesh and define a bivariate spline surface from the control mesh, which mimics the standard NURBS modeling. Moreover, we can easily introduce sharp features into the overall smooth spline surface by simply setting special D1RC configurations. As a result, the proposed scheme can define spline surfaces in a way similar to that of NURBS, but has less restriction on the connectivity of the input control mesh.

segmentation aims to parse the scene structure of images by annotating the labels to each pixel so that images can be segmented into different regions. While image structures usually have various scales, it is difficult to use a single scale to model the spatial contexts for allindividual pixels. Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their variants have made striking success for modeling the global scene structure for an image. However, they are limited in labeling fine-grained local structures like pixels and patches, since spatial contexts might be blindly mixed up without appropriately customizing their scales. To address this challenge, we develop a novel paradigm of multi-scale deep network to model spatial contexts surrounding different pixels at various scales. It builds multiple layers of memory cells, learning feature representations for individual pixels at their customized scales by hierarchically absorbing relevant spatial contexts via memory gates between layers. Such Hierarchically Gated Deep Networks (HGDNs) can customize a suitable scale for each pixel, thereby delivering better performance on labeling scene structures of various scales. We conduct the experiments on two datasets, and show competitive results compared with the other multi-scale deep networks on the semantic segmentation task.

The broad market penetration, however, is hindered by several shortcomings of the technology. The limited driving range, high cost and long charging times discourage consumers. Our research is addressing this issue by utilizing information from upcoming sensor technologies to build energy-optimized driving and operation strategies instead of using cost-expensive solutions for driving range optimization based on an enlarged battery capacity or mechanical changes. This talk will present different approaches for driving range optimization which have been successfully evaluated by an experimental battery electric vehicle: A novel torque distribution algorithm exploits the overactuated powertrain of the demonstrator vehicle to increase the energy-efficiency, while a green cruise control system is adaptively optimizing speed profiles according to real time data on the currently driven road. Another challenging issue specific to battery electric vehicle is the high energy consumption for climate control (HVAC), which is second only to the powertrain. By combining the developed strategies, an increase in range of 26% was possible on a public road at a cost of only 8% increased travel time. Both, the basic principles of the systems as well as a detailed view on the results achieved in simulation and on public road driving tests will be displayed during the presentation including a trade-off discussion between range optimization and travel time.","speaker":{"name":"Oliver Bringmann","aid":"54053a01dabfae92b41b6b47","affiliation":"Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen

Using data from Amazon.com, we analyze the patterns of Amazon’s entry into its third-party sellers’ product spaces. We find evidence consistent with the former explanation: that the likelihood of Amazon’s entry is positively correlated with the popularity and customer ratings of third-party sellers’ products. We also find that Amazon’s entry reduces the shipping costs of affected products and hence increases their demand. Results also show that small third-party sellers affected by Amazon’s entry appear to be discouraged from growing their businesses on the platform subsequently.

We are interested in studying the interaction between DNA and metal for analytical applications. This talk will cover three aspects. 1) In vitro selection of metal-specific DNAzymes. DNAzymes are DNA-based catalysts and we focus on RNA-cleaving DNAzymes. Using lanthanide ions as cofactors, we isolated a suite of new DNAzymes that can selectively detect rare-earth metals. By using phosphorothioate modified DNAzymes, we developed new probes for a few toxic heavy metal ions. 2) The adsorption of DNA by various metal oxides were studied, where the phosphate backbone of DNA is shown to be critical for the adsorption reaction. Using fluorescently labeled DNA, highly sensitive detection of arsenate and hydrogen peroxide was achieved. 3) DNA adsorption by gold nanoparticles is studied as a function of salt concentration and pH. Based on this study, we developed an ultrasensitive method for functionalizing gold surface with DNA.","speaker":{"name":"Juewen Liu","aid":"5484b517dabfae8a11fb223d","affiliation":"Department of Chemistry, University of Waterloo","bio":"刘珏文，加拿大滑铁卢大学化学系副教授，博士生导师。2000年获中国科技大学化学系本科学位。2005年获美国伊利诺伊大学(UIUC)化学系博士学位（导师Yi Lu教授），课题方向为脱氧核酸酶在金属离子检测中的应用。2005-2007年继续在Dr. Yi Lu实验室进行博士后工作。2007-2009年在美国新墨西哥大学和Sandia国家实验室进行基于介孔氧化硅的药物传递系统的博士后研究工作（导师 C.

We revisit classic operations management problems, e.g., the multi-product newsvendor and observable/unobservable queues by taking into account social interactions among consumers. We also study a firm’s pricing and information management decisions in the context of group buying, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing and sales of network goods. Lastly, we consider the social interactions among decision makers, such as newsvendors.

circuit (IC) is one of the most important inventions that have helped shape the entire information revolution. As the feature size enters the era of extreme scaling (14nm, 11nm, and beyond), IC design and manufacturing challenges are exacerbated, due to the adoption of multiple patterning and other emerging lithography technologies. Meanwhile, new ways of “equivalent” scaling such as 2.5D/3D IC have gained tremendous interest and initial industry adoption, and new devices/materials such as nanophotonics are making their headways to on-chip integration. Furthermore, IC design and CAD methodologies are being pushed to new frontiers, e.g., into bio-chips, healthcare, and Internet-of-Things, where energy and security are major concerns. This talk will discuss some key technology trends and challenges in nanometer IC design and manufacturing closure in extreme scaling and beyond, and discuss some opportunities and recent research results.

A hidden Markov model captures the changing pattern of critical market situations, such as expansion and contraction. The predictions of rating changes over time are then jointly determined contingent upon changes in firm leverage, liquidity and profitability, and the concurrent macroeconomic conditions. The probabilities of firms’ credit rating change (upgrade, stay, downgrade or default) are determined by a regime-switching multinomial logistic regression model using firms’ accounting data. In the empirical analysis, we find that the likelihood of upgrade and downgrade are asymmetric across regimes. The asymmetry of credit rating changes between the high and low rated firms appears to be different from those firms that have an average rating level.","speaker":{"name":"yonggan zhao","aid":"53f438dadabfaeecd6976448","affiliation":"Canada Research Chair (Tier II), School of Business Administration, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada","bio":"赵永淦博士，加拿大风险管理研究讲席教授，现任职于加拿大大尔豪斯大学商学院金融系。自2000年12 月毕业于加拿大不列颠大学商学院之后，曾任职于新加坡南洋理工大学, 美国普林斯顿大学的客座研究员。主要研究方向有投资组合，金融衍生产品定价与设计，金融风险管理。在金融学，经济学，和管理科学等领域里发表论文三十余篇。多次主持加拿大国家自然科学基金，社会科学基金， 和加拿大创新基金项目。研究成果曾获得北美金融年会最佳论文奖, 并为多个对冲基金和投资机构的投资顾问。他是 Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences, Journal of Management Mathematics, and Quantitative Finance Letters现任副主编. 曾任两届加拿大拿省华人协会主席。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/482/464/352/53f438dadabfaeecd6976448.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-16T06:08:00Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a43ed19ed5dbc2a8c0f3bc","type":0,"title":"How to Select the Top k Elements from Evolving Data?","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学校学术活动中心二楼小报告厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-16T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-16T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"计算机与信息学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"We investigate the top-k-selection problem, i.e. to determine and sort the top k elements, in a dynamic data model. In this model the underlying total order evolves over time, and the order can only be probed by pair-wise comparisons. Previously only two special cases were studied under this model: selecting the element of a given rank, and sorting all elements. In this talk we will systematically deals with all k\\\\in [n]. Specifically, we identify the critical point k∗ such that the top-k-selection problem can be solved error-free with probability 1 − o(1) if and only if k = o(k∗). A lower bound of the error when k = Ω(k∗) is also determined, which actually is tight under some conditions. In contrast, we show that the top-k-set problem, which means finding the top k elements without sorting them, can be solved error-free with probability 1 − o(1) for all 1≤k≤n.

The amount of Fe in porphyry deposits is commonly overlooked because it is mainly contained as pyrite in phyllic alteration, which is not normally part of the orebody and is not reported in resource figures; lesser magnetite coexists with chalcopyrite in mineralized rocks. In this sense, the predominant form of iron in these deposits is their defining difference, with Fe-sulfides predominating in porphyries, and Fe-oxides (magnetite and hematite) in IOCG deposits. From an ore fluid geochemical perspective, both deposit types require moderately high-temperature, oxidized saline brines for the efficient transport of Cu and Fe (and trace Au). The main difference appears to be that porphyry fluids also carry large amounts of sulfur (dissolved initially as SO2), resulting in the precipitation of abundant Fe-sulfides and sulfates upon cooling, along with volumetrically minor but economically important Cu-Fe-sulfides. In contrast, IOCG fluids appear to be relatively sulfur poor and precipitate the bulk of the Fe in oxide form (still with volumetrically minor Cu-Fe-sulfides). Because fluids with these basic geochemical characteristics can be generated in a variety of natural settings, ranging from magmatic-hydrothermal to deep sedimentary basins, a wide range of genetic processes have been proposed for IOCG deposits. If iron oxide-apatite deposits are included in the IOCG spectrum, then the range is argued by some to extend to fluxed Fe-oxide melts.","speaker":{"name":"Jeremy  Richards","aid":"53f43b58dabfaedce555fc3b","affiliation":"University of Alberta","bio":"Jeremy Richards教授于1983年于剑桥大学获得地质学学士学位、1986年于加拿大多伦多大学获得矿床学硕士学位、于1990年在澳大利亚国立大学获得矿床学博士学位。随后在加拿大萨斯喀彻温大学、英国莱斯特大学、加拿大阿尔伯塔大学进行教学科研工作。并于2002年在阿尔伯塔大学晋升教授至今。Jeremy Richards教授是国际著名矿床学家，在斑岩铜矿体系研究领域建树颇丰，近年来他的研究兴趣主要集中在俯冲-碰撞体制下构造-岩浆-成矿作用，对北美、南美、中东及西南太平洋地区开展了深入研究。目前，Jeremy Richards教授已经发表学术论文超过80篇（大部分为第一作者），并主要刊登在Geology、GCA、Economic Geology和Nature Geosciences等地学顶级期刊上。除此之外，他还担任Economic Geology和Nature Scientific Report的副主编。2015年，为表彰他在矿床学基础研究领域的杰出贡献，国际经济地质协会（SEG）授予他中青年科学家最高奖-银奖（SEG Silver Medal），并当选为2016年SEG专刊主编。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/1658/446/733/53f43b58dabfaedce555fc3b.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-15T08:12:20Z","uid":"566f891645ce0bb16f69c2e0","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a43fa99ed5dbc2a8c0f446","type":0,"title":"How to publish in Journal of Productivity Analysis","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学翡翠湖校区逸夫建筑艺术馆703室"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-02T01:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-02T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"经济学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"In this talk I will use my own experience as an associate editor and also as an author to try to provide some guidelines to authors that wish to publish in top journals, such as JPA.

Two fundamental assumptions have to be made in most of the scenarios. (1.) There is a secret key unknown to the adversary; (2.) The implementations faithfully realize the cryptographic algorithms; Unfortunately, we have witnessed real-world attack scenarios in which those two assumptions do not necessarily hold. In this talk, I will explain how we can stretch crypto to defend against those crippling insider attacks. First, I will use copyright protection as an application to exemplify how we may design cryptosystems to enforce (potentially dishonest) key owner accountability in a multi-recipient encryption scenario. In particular, I will introduce and construct a new cryptographic primitive called traitor deterring scheme (TDS) for this goal. The distinguishing characteristic of a TDS is that if a dishonest subscriber A distributes a pirate decoder, it would lead to the revelation of some collateral information of A. Furthermore, I will demonstrate how to use Bitcoin as the monetary deterrence to de-incentivize unauthorized re-distribution of pirate decoders. Second, I will discuss our recent progress on a new direction called cliptography: tackling the fundamental practical challenge of guaranteeing security without trust in underlying cryptographic implementations. Our results lay down the foundation of this emerging area. In particular, I will give an overview of this topic, and briefly discuss how we resolve the central problem of defending against subliminal channel attacks when using subverted randomized algorithms, and how we may build a parallel theory of crypto in this new setting.","speaker":{"name":" Qiang Tang","affiliation":"Cornell University","bio":"Dr. Qiang Tang is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University, he is also affiliated with the Initiative for Cryptocurrency and Contracts (IC3).

This is the first result to tell the difference on computational complexity between two important diffusion models, the IC model and the LT model in social networks.","speaker":{"name":"ding-zhu du","aid":"548e5b58dabfaef989f09344","affiliation":"The University of Texas at Dallas","bio":"Ding-Zhu Du （堵丁柱）received his M.S. degree in 1982 from Institute of Applied Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and his Ph.D. degree in 1985 from the University of California at Santa Barbara.

Due consideration has been given to couple the radiative heat transfer and soot treatment with pyrolysis calculations. Combustion is modelled using the newly extended eddy dissipation concept (EDC) for multi-component fuels published by the authors’ group. Soot formation and oxidation are handled by the published extension of the laminar smoke point concept to turbulent fires using the partially stirred reactor (PaSR) concept also from the authors’ group. The gases radiation properties are evaluated using the established weighted sum of grey gas model while soot absorption coefficient is calculated using a single Planck-mean absorption coefﬁcient. The effect of in-depth radiation is treated with the relatively simple Beer’s law and the solid surface regression rate is calculated from the local pyrolysis rate. Systematic validation studies have been conducted with several published experiments including simple pyrolysis test without the gaseous region, small scale wall fires and large scale flame spread. The predictions are in very good agreement with the relevant experimental data, demonstrating that the present modelling approach can be used to predict upward flame spread over PMMA with reasonable accuracy. Such a fully coupled predictive tool can be used to aid fundamental studies of the flame spread phenomena such as investigating the effects of width, inclination angles and side walls on flame spread.  Large eddy simulation of a mechanically ventilated compartment fireThis presentation deals with the modelling of a mechanically ventilated compartment fire which is a commonplace in nuclear fire scenarios. An advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) field model with a wall conjugate heat transfer treatment is proposed. It simultaneously solves the compartment fire flow and the wall heat conduction. The flow solver is based on the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) based fire simulation solver FireFOAM within the frame of open source CFD code OpenFOAM®. An extended eddy dissipation model is used to calculate the chemical reaction rate. A soot model based on the concept of smoke point height is employed to model the soot formation and oxidation. A finite volume method is adopted to model the radiative heat transfer. The ventilation flow is modelled by a simplified Bernoulli equation neglecting the detailed information on the ventilation system. The proposed model is validated against a single room fire test with forced mechanical ventilations. The predictions are in reasonably good agreement with experimental data.","speaker":{"name":"Xiaoling Wen (Jennifer Wen)","aid":"5619ec3345ce1e596451e03a","affiliation":"School of

Motivated by the partial consistency phenomena, we propose to model g(Z) via incidental parameters. Based on partitioning the support of Z, a simple local average is used to estimate the response surface. The proposed method seeks to strike a balance between computation burden and efficiency of the estimators while minimizing model bias. Computationally this approach only involves least squares. We show that given the inconsistent estimator of g(Z), a root n consistent estimator of parametric component of the partially linear model can be obtained with little cost in efficiency. Moreover, conditional on the _ estimates, an optimal estimator of g(Z) can then be obtained using classic nonparametric methods. The statistical inference problem regarding _ and a two-population nonparametric testing problem regarding g(Z) are considered. Our results show that the behavior of test statistics are satisfactory. To assess the performance of our method in comparison with other methods, three simulation studies are conducted and a real dataset about risk factors of birth weights is analyzed.","speaker":{"name":"Heng Peng","aid":"53f430b1dabfaee02ac8a91c","affiliation":"Department of Mathematics, The Hong Kong Baptist University","bio":"彭衡, 香港浸会大学副教授； 97年 本科毕业于中国科学技术大学, 2003年获得香港中文大学 统计学博士，04-06年普林斯顿大学博士后。 主要研究方向，高维数据、模型选择、非参数回归、变点问题统计推断等研究。发表SCI学术论文近30篇，其中在统 计类的Top 期刊发表学术论文7篇，其中在04年在 《The Annals of Statistics》 上发表的关于 模型变量选择的论文已经被他引295次。 担任过《Statistica Sinica》（泛华统计） 副主编。目前在香港正承担多 个政府和学校的科研基金项目。","position":"Associate Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/1566/1095/1022/53f430b1dabfaee02ac8a91c.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-16T08:31:16Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a440059ed5dbc2a8c0f491","type":0,"title":"板块俯冲与成矿 ","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学纬地楼4楼报告厅 "},"time":{"from":"2016-03-07T01:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-07T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"资源与环境工程学院 ","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Weidong Sun","aid":"5429def8dabfaec7081c26cc","affiliation":"Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry,Chinese Academy of Sciences","bio":"孙卫东研究员，洪堡学者、百人计划、杰青、“新世纪百千万人才工程”国家级人选，广东省“南粤百杰”。国家基金委创新研究群体学术带头人、国家基金委重大项目负责人。在元素地球化学与成矿领域取得了一系列原创性成果：发现磁铁矿结晶对氧逸度和铜金性质的控制，被国际同行称为“磁铁矿危机”，该成果2004年以第一作者论文在Nature发表后，带动了矿床地球化学界有关岛弧岩浆磁铁矿结晶与成矿关系的研究；厘定了矿化剂硫、氯的地球化学行为与成矿，揭示了高氧逸度控制斑岩铜金成矿的机理和最佳成矿条件。发现铼在陆相岛弧火山岩中具有挥发性，修正了其陆壳丰度，解决了“铼钇悖论”；发现铌钽钛等传统上认为最不活动的元素，在板块俯冲过程中十分活动，解决了“铌钽悖论”，进而为揭示大陆地壳成因提供了关键制约；通过铌铀等元素地球化学研究提出并论证了地幔柱成因的新模型。首次综合利用微量元素和矿物包裹体准确限定锆石年龄的地质意义，测定了南秦岭同碰撞型花岗岩的年龄，限定了华南华北间地缝合线的位置；解析了板块俯冲与中国东部中生代以来重要地质事件的内在联系，发现太平洋漂移方向多次大的转变对应中国东部重要的地质事件，提出长江中下游大规模成矿与洋脊俯冲有关。发表论文240余篇，SCI他引3000余次，入选ISI 全球地学高引用率科学家名录，6篇文章入选高引用率论文。曾获国家自然科学奖二等奖。现任矿物岩石地球化学学会同位素专业委员会主任、Solid Earth Sci主编、GCA, AG《地球化学》副主编、IODP科学评价委员。经济地质学家学会Fellow，曾任该学会亚洲区副主席；现任地球化学终身成就奖戈尔德施密特奖评奖委员。","position":"Researcher","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/1254/1190/1048/5429def8dabfaec7081c26cc.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-16T08:36:35Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a440079ed5dbc2a8c0f492","type":0,"title":"先进功率半导体器件的挑战与应用","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学屯溪路校区东教201"},"time":{"from":"2016-01-18T00:00:00Z","to":"2016-01-18T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"电气与自动化工程学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"leo lorenz","aid":"561eda8645cedb3398160272","affiliation":"German Academy of Science","bio":"LEO LORENZ，1976年在德国柏林大学获工学硕士学位；1984年在德国慕尼黑大学获博士学位；2006年 获得IEEE FELLOW称号，并成为德国科学院成员。除了工业界的多项技术主管工作，劳伦斯博士还在德国和全世界的多所大学被聘为荣誉和客座教授。在功率半导体器件领域指导超过20名博士生。发表超过400篇论文，获得超过40项发明专利授权。在多个国际会议和主题峰会受邀做主题演讲。 劳伦斯博士在多个研究所（Fraunhofer Institute, Robert Bosch Center, CORPE Denmar等）和政府研究组织担任技术顾问，以及研究基金项目的评审员。劳伦斯博士是欧洲电力电子中心（ECPE, European Center of Power Electronics）的创立者并担任该中心主席至今。劳伦斯先生还是多个国际会议的创立者和联合创立者，包括CIPS (Conference on Integrated Power Systems), EPE (European Power Electric Conference), PCIM 亚洲, ISPSD等，并多次担任大会主席。劳伦斯博士在多个IEEE国际会议上获得最佳论文奖，在1996，1998，1999年获得西门子创新奖。在2002年获得德国工业协会创新奖。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/660/1017/855/561eda8645cedb3398160272.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-16T08:40:34Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a440099ed5dbc2a8c0f493","type":0,"title":"Video Game as a Service − Cloud Computing Enabled Video Gaming Anywhere on Any Device","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学学术会议中心第三会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-01-15T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-01-15T04:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"电气与自动化工程学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":" There is a growing demand by consumers to access their digital entertainments, which are increasingly cloud-based, whenever and wherever they have access to networks of diverse characteristics, and using whatever devices they have in their hands. To address this diversity, we have embarked on a project is to develop design methodologies and enabling technologies to support “play anywhere on any device, pause and resume on any device” capabilities in next-generation cloud-based video games. In particular, scalable and ubiquitous computing resources in the cloud can enable sophisticated video games to be played on mobile devices that have limited processing and storage capacities. In this talk, we start with an introduction of UBC, the ECE department, and the research activities of the WinMoS Lab. We shall give an overview of the general characteristics of mobile cloud computing and related research issues. We propose a cloud-based video game system with cooperative video sharing over a secondary ad hoc wireless network. Experimental results show that the expected server transmission rate can be significantly reduced compared to the conventional video encoding schemes for cloud games. We conclude with a discussion on our ongoing research to develop a cognitive framework that will provide “video game as a service” to players using a variety of devices to access computer games in the cloud over different wireless and wireline networks with diverse quality of service characteristics.

They often undergo large deformation coupled with solvent diffusion, in response to mechanical and chemical stimuli. To study the complex, transient behavior of hydrogels, we develop a mixed finite element method based on a nonlinear continuum theory of polymer gels. The numerical stability and convergence are examined for constrained swelling of hydrogel layers. Next, the numerical method is used to study the effect of solvent diffusion on fracture of hydrogels. A transient energy release rate is defined for crack growth in hydrogels based on a modified path-independent J-integral, separating the energy lost in diffusion from the energy available to drive crack growth. Numerical simulations are performed for center-cracked hydrogel specimens, subject to remote tension under generalized plane strain conditions. The hydrogel specimen is assumed to be either immersed in a solvent or not-immersed by imposing different chemical boundary conditions. Comparisons to linear elastic fracture mechanics are presented for the crack-tip fields and crack opening profiles in the instantaneous and equilibrium limits. It is found that the stress singularity at the crack tip depends on both the far-field strain and the local solvent diffusion, and the latter evolves with time and depends on the chemical boundary conditions. The transient energy release rate is predicted as a function of time for the two types of boundary conditions with distinct behaviors due to solvent diffusion. Possible scenarios of delayed fracture are discussed based on evolution of the transient energy release rate.","speaker":{"name":"rui huang","aid":"53f7cb95dabfae9467db603f","affiliation":"Pearlie Dashiell Henderson Centennial Fellowship in Engineering","bio":"黄锐(Rui Huang)，美国得克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校(The University of Texas at Austin)航空工程和工程力学系教授。1994年中国科学技术大学近代力学系获得学士学位，1996年获得硕士学位，2001年美国普林斯顿大学(Princeton University)获得土木工程博士学位，2001年至2002年普林斯顿大学博士后。2002年9月起加入得克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校航空工程与力学系，2014年晋升为教授(Professor)。研究领域主要涉及薄膜力学，纳米力学，软物质力学等。在相关研究领域的顶级期刊Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, Nano Letters, Advanced Materials, Nature Nanotechnology, Science, Soft Matter等杂志上发表论文90余篇。论文总引用超过3500次，其中6篇论文单篇引用超过100次，SCI H-index为32。2006至2011年获美国国家科学基金会CAREER资助项目，先后组织参与国际学术会议多次，并担任多家国际期刊编委。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/1852/309/950/53f7cb95dabfae9467db603f.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-15T09:22:58Z","uid":"566f891645ce0bb16f69c2e0","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a441c49ed5dbc2a8c0f512","type":0,"title":"Data Envelopment Analysis vs. Analytics (数据包括分析与分析学)","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学管理楼一楼第一报告厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-02T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-02T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"管理学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"This talk discusses directions for DEA research as a data-driven analytics.

It will describe in particular the Buncefield fuel depot explosion on 11 December 2005, which resulted in the largest fire in Europe since World War II. Although these incidents are normally of low frequency, i.e. they do not happen very often, they generally have high consequences in terms of property loss, disruption and in some cases human injuries and casualties. Their unusually “high frequency” over the past decade have triggered major investigations by industry and regulators. An overview of these investigations will be provided. This will be followed by research conducted by my own group in these contexts, including fuel cascade, detonation of pancake shaped clouds, explosion modelling, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) pool fires. These research activities are almost exclusively based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques and combustion modelling, while published laboratory scale experimental data and proprietary large scale test data conducted by our collaborators in industry have been used for model verification and validation. Substantial amount of efforts have been devoted to developing physics based sub-models within the frame of open source CFD code OpenFOAM®. The ultimate goal is to advance our understanding of the underlying physical and chemical processes in these incidents and provide validated predictive tools, which can be used for consequence analysis and development of safety cases in the petrochemical industry.","speaker":{"name":"Xiaoling Wen (Jennifer Wen)","aid":"5619ec3345ce1e596451e03a","affiliation":"School of Engineering,University of Warwick","bio":"温晓玲，英国华威大学工程系教授，博导，火灾和爆炸研究领域的世界知名专家。在火灾、气体爆炸、二氧化碳输送安全、氢安全等方面的研究取得了突出的研究成果，且成果受国际同行高度评价，被政府机构及英美多家跨国公司采用。发表近200篇高水平学术论文，其中包括本领域国际顶级学术刊物 Combustion and Flame, Combustion Science and Technology, Fire Safety Journal, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Numerical Heat Transfer, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industry 等。近五年，Jennifer Wen承担科研课题多项，总经费4000多万元。还13次受邀作国际会议大会报告，6次特邀报告。被国际同行引用数百次。现任英国爆炸协会指导委员会委员、国际氢安全指导委员会委员、燃烧和火灾动力学国际会议科学委员会委员、乙炔气瓶灾后评估特别咨询专家组成员、国际氢安全科学委员会委员、国际火灾安全协会会员、爆炸动力学和反应系统国际会议科学委员会委员、国际氢能源期刊安全特刊首席编辑、中国科学技术大学《火灾科学》杂志编委、英国工程及物理科学基金会评委专家、 欧盟基金会评委专家、比利时/卡塔尔/塞浦路斯/香港和德国基金会评委专家、美国能源部优异审查和同行评价特邀专家。曾任清华、香港城市大学及英国阿尔斯特大学客座教授,现任大连理工大学、武警学院客座教授。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/1747/463/518/5619ec3345ce1e596451e03a.png"},"subtime":"2016-08-16T07:03:28Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a441db9ed5dbc2a8c0f51c","type":0,"title":"Taylor & Francis科技期刊数据库的利用","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学屯溪路校区图书馆东楼306室（培训教室）"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-14T06:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-14T08:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"图书馆","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":" Taylor & Francis出版集团作为世界领先的学术性期刊、图书、电子书及参考工具书出版社之一，出版内容遍及人文、社会科学、行为科学、科学技术和医学等各个领域。目前在全球范围内出版1800余种期刊，且依托旗下知名品牌Routledge，已成为SSCI收录期刊数量最多的社会科学出版社。Taylor & Francis科技期刊数据库提供5个学科460余种经专家评审的高质量科技类期刊, 其中80%的科技期刊被SCI收录。内容最早至1997年，培训将着重说明与环境、农业、计算机、工程等相关的期刊内容。 该讲座主要介绍Taylor & Francis科技期刊数据库的主要内容、平台使用及移动设备配置功能，可帮助全校读者更好地利用该数据库平台检索到自己想要的相关电子资源。 详见：http://210.45.242.3/ShowPage.aspx?art_id=1826","speaker":{"name":"雷彬","affiliation":"Taylor & Francis顾问","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-08-05T07:35:55Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a441dc9ed5dbc2a8c0f520","type":0,"title":" A New Approach to Constructing Quadratic Pseudo-Planar Functions over GF_2^n","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学 数学学科楼310办公室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-07T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-07T10:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"数学学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":" Planar functions over finite fields give rise to finite projective planes. They were also used in the constructions of DES-like iterated ciphers, error-correcting codes, and codebooks. They were originally defined only in finite fields with odd characteristic, but recently Zhou introduced pesudo-planar functions in even characteristic which yields similar applications. All known pesudo-planar functions are quadratic and hence they give presemifields. In this paper, a new approach to constructing quadratic pseudo-planar functions is given. Then five explicit families of pseudo-planar functions are constructed, one of which is a binomial, two of which are trinomials, and the other two are quadrinomials. All known pesudo-planar functions are revisited, some of which are generalized. These functions not only lead to projective planes, relative difference sets and presemifields, but also give optimal codebooks meeting the Levenstein bound, complete sets of mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and good compressed sensing matrices.","speaker":{"name":"longjiang qu","aid":"53f4709fdabfaee2a1dd71a3","affiliation":"National University of Defense Technology","bio":"屈龙江，男，河南新县人，1980年11月生，2002年、2007年在国防科技大学理学院数学与系统科学系分别获理学学士学位和博士学位，后留校任教。现为该系教授，国家自然科学基金通讯评议专家，美国Math Review评论员，IEEE 会员，中国密码学会会员，入选教育部新世纪人才计划和国防科技大学首届青年拔尖人才计划。从事编码密码理论及其应用研究，在密码函数的安全性指标分析、对称密码算法安全性分析等方面取得一系列研究成果，在《IEEE Trans. on Inform.

人，其中资料完整285 人，男性141人，女性144人； 38.95%的老人患有高血压，他们对接受服药提醒、血压测量、高血压知识、预防高血压等健康信息的需求较高。在对照研究实施的6个月内，（1）研究开始2个月后，干预组与对照组舒张压的平均改变量差异为3.73mmHg（95% CI，-2.21—9.67mmHg），p>0.05；干预组与对照组收缩压的平均改变量差异为2.73mmHg（95% CI，-8.26—13.71mmHg），p>0.05。（2）5个月后，干预组与对照组舒张压的平均改变量差异为1.36mmHg（95% CI，-4.57—7.30mmHg），p>0.05；干预组与对照组收缩压的平均改变量差异为-0.27mmHg（95% CI，-9.87—9.33mmHg），p<0.05。故仅可认为研究开始5个月后，收缩压与基线血压值的改变量在干预组和对照组之间有统计学差异。结论：兰州市城关区老人高血压发病率偏高；身体素质以及健康知识需求明确。使用移动医疗技术干预社区老人血压管理可以有效管理高血压，但与对照组相比，血压差异无统计学意义，移动医疗技术应用于老年血压及其他慢性疾病管理的效果还有待进一步研究验证。","speaker":{"name":"bai

Such a system decodes the user’s intention from brain signal and translates it into device commands. For both rehabilitation or communication systems based on BCI, the latency of the decoding algorithms is the fundamental factor which directly determines the systems’ performance. In this talk, movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP) were investigated as the signal modality for real-time detection of motor intention from EEG. Aiming at a short-latency brain switch based on MRCP, a manifold leaning based method was developed, which significantly outperformed the previous methods. Based on this brain switch, two closed BCI systems were implemented for rehabilitation and communication purpose, respectively. In the rehabilitation system, the brain switch was used to trigger a motorized ankle-foot orthosis, mimicking real movement of dorsiflexion, for natural afferent feedback. Such a closed-loop system was tested on healthy subjects, and the neuroplasticity measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation was induced with only ∼ 15-min intervention. Further, the brain switch was extended to a multi-class BCI for communication purpose, by combining an electrotactile menu. The online testing on healthy subjects demonstrated its desirable properties of gaze-independence, high information transfer rate, and vast applicability.","speaker":{"name":" 徐仁","affiliation":"奥地利G.Tec医疗工程有限公司","bio":"Ren Xu is currently working as a research scientist at g.tec medical engineering, Austria.

Our group has been studying the supramolecular chemistry of chemically converted graphene and how non-covalent interactions can be utilized to create carbon-based functional soft materials that are difficult to obtain with other techniques. Learning from nature, we have demonstrated that hydration of graphene not only enables its solution processability, but more importantly, offers simple and scalable ways to assemble graphene into well-controlled nano-architectures with extraordinary macroscopic properties. Highlighting the key role of supramolecular chemistry in the formation of several unusual graphene-based functional materials, this talk will share my personal view on some future directions of graphene-based soft materials, particularly on its implications on nanoionics.","speaker":{"name":" Dan Li","affiliation":"Monash University, Australia","bio":" 李丹，工学博士。现为澳大利亚蒙纳士大学（澳洲八大名校的盟校成员）材料科学与工程系教授。1993年毕业于南京理工大学化学化工学院应用化学专业，获学士学位，1996年毕业于同校材料化学专业获硕士学位，1999年毕业于电子科技大学材料科学与工程系，获得工学博士学位。1996年6月至2006年6月先后在南京理工大学化工学院、美国西雅图华盛顿大学化学系及纳米技术研究中心、加州大学洛杉矶分校化学与生物化学系及加州纳米系统研究院从事博士后研究。2006年加入澳大利亚卧龙岗大学澳大利亚科学委员会电子材料科学国家重点实验室担任研究员；2008年加入蒙纳士大学材料工程系任副教授并创建纳米碳及软材料实验室；2012年晋升教授；2015年创建蒙纳士大学石墨烯及二维材料研究中心并担任共同主任。从2006年起在国际上率先开展了基于石墨烯的软材料研究。已发表90多篇国际同行评议论文（包括2篇Science, 1篇Science Advances, 1篇Nature Nanotechnology, 1篇Nature Materials, 2篇Nature Communications, 11篇Advanced Materials, 2篇in Advanced Functional Materials, 1篇Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1篇Angewandte Chemie), 获得超过15000的引用，H因子为 47，篇均引用次数超过180。两篇文章入选汤森路透材料科学领域2004-2014间前12名高引用论文。2006年获得澳大利亚科学委员会以伊丽莎白女王二世命名的研究员奖，2010年荣获澳大利亚 Scopus 青年科学家奖（科技与工程类唯一获奖者）， 2011年获得澳大利亚科学委员会未来之星研究员奖，2014-2015年入选国际顶尖智库—汤森路透《全球高引用科学家榜单》及《全球最具影响力的科研精英》名录。","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-08-05T07:37:13Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a4422b9ed5dbc2a8c0f54d","type":0,"title":" 明胶的绿色生产工艺及其应用研究","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学屯溪路校区人文南楼303会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-01-05T01:00:00Z","to":"2016-01-05T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"医学工程学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Yanchuan Guo","aid":"542bef1cdabfae1ad8956f90","affiliation":"Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry,Chinese Academy of Sciences","bio":"郭燕川，博士，研究员，2010年在中科院理化所获理学博士学位。中国科学院理化所明胶与微纳米碳材料研究室负责人，生物材料与应用技术研究中心副主任、中科院－东宝生物“明胶与胶原蛋白工程应用研究中心”主任，中国轻工业协会明胶分会理事、科技委主任、副秘书长，《明胶科学与技术》杂志副主编。2010年至2011年作为访问学者在加州大学洛杉矶分校基础医学院从事分子生物学研究工作。2012－2014年与瑞典乌普萨拉大学开展生物活性陶瓷医学应用研究。承担国家科技部、财政部、中科院、北京市、国家自然科学基金项目10余项，发表论文80余篇，SCI收录30余篇，申请中国专利35项，其中授权16项，美国专利2项。承担企业合作项目10余项，其中明胶、胶原肽绿色制造技术成功推动东宝生物（300239）、宁鑫生科（833876）两家公司上市。","position":"Researcher","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/2008/506/58/542bef1cdabfae1ad8956f90.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-16T09:04:15Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a4422f9ed5dbc2a8c0f54e","type":0,"title":"Tectonomagmatic controls on arc metallogeny","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学纬地楼4楼会议室（425）"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-05T01:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-05T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"资源与环境工程学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"二十世纪六七十年代板块构造模型建立时，地质学家就意识到板块构造过程对成矿的基本控制。如海洋扩张中心形成VMS矿床，大陆裂谷形成多种沉积矿床，岛弧环境形成斑岩型和低温热液型矿床和花岗岩有关的矿床。最近，斑岩-浅成低温热液型矿床和一些IOCG矿床的形成被认为是受俯冲变质交代事件影响岩石圈（或者是其他类型的地幔）重新活化所导致。 根本上，这些类型矿床发映了地幔到地表的热和挥发分的集中对流，这些对流物质通常以岩浆或者流体或者同时以两种形式传输到地表；板块边界为这些热流提供了通道。在汇聚板块边缘，俯冲大洋岩石圈开始脱水释放到地幔楔，，导致发生熔融，水、S、Cl和一些其他的溶于水的成分形成初生岩浆，岩浆上升演化并与上覆岩石圈混染产生含水的中酸性岩浆，岩浆进一步上升侵位到上地壳，由于降压作用和冷却结晶作用导致含矿矿质的挥发分出溶形成斑岩型和浅成低温热液型矿床。The fundamental control of plate tectonic processes on ore formation was realized almost as soon as the plate tectonic model was established in the late 1960s-early 1970s. The formation of seafloor massive sulfide deposits at oceanic spreading centers, various types of sediment-hosted deposits in continental rifts, porphyry and epithermal deposits in volcanic arcs above subduction zones, and granite-related ore deposits in continental collision settings were quickly established. More recently, the formation of porphyry, epithermal, and some types of IOCG deposits has been recognized to occur by remobilization of lithosphere previously affected by prior episodes of subduction (or other types of mantle) metasomatism. At root, these ore deposit types reflect the focused convection of heat and volatiles from the mantle towards the surface. Plate boundaries provide high-permeability pathways for this heat and mass flux, which is transmitted to the surface either directly as magmas or fluids (or both). At convergent margins, the flux begins with dehydration (and in some cases melting) of subducting oceanic lithosphere, which releases water, S, Cl, and other fluid-soluble components into the mantle wedge, triggering partial melting. Ascent of these partial melts into, and interaction with, the upper plate lithosphere generates hydrous intermediate-composition magmas, which rise into the upper crust where volatiles are exsolved due to decompression and crystallization. These hydrothermal fluids may go on to form porphyry and epithermal deposits if their flow is focused and sustained by a large magma supply.","speaker":{"name":"Jeremy  Richards","aid":"53f43b58dabfaedce555fc3b","affiliation":"University of Alberta","bio":"Jeremy Richards教授于1983年于剑桥大学获得地质学学士学位、1986年于加拿大多伦多大学获得矿床学硕士学位、于1990年在澳大利亚国立大学获得矿床学博士学位。随后在加拿大萨斯喀彻温大学、英国莱斯特大学、加拿大阿尔伯塔大学进行教学科研工作。并于2002年在阿尔伯塔大学晋升教授至今。Jeremy Richards教授是国际著名矿床学家，在斑岩铜矿体系研究领域建树颇丰，近年来他的研究兴趣主要集中在俯冲-碰撞体制下构造-岩浆-成矿作用，对北美、南美、中东及西南太平洋地区开展了深入研究。目前，Jeremy Richards教授已经发表学术论文超过80篇（大部分为第一作者），并主要刊登在Geology、GCA、Economic Geology和Nature Geosciences等地学顶级期刊上。除此之外，他还担任Economic Geology和Nature Scientific Report的副主编。2015年，为表彰他在矿床学基础研究领域的杰出贡献，国际经济地质协会（SEG）授予他中青年科学家最高奖-银奖（SEG Silver Medal），并当选为2016年SEG专刊主编。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/avatar/1658/446/733/53f43b58dabfaedce555fc3b.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-08-15T08:13:24Z","uid":"566f891645ce0bb16f69c2e0","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a442319ed5dbc2a8c0f54f","type":0,"title":"页岩非均质性及微观力学特性研究—以Ordos盆地陆相页岩为例","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学纬地楼4楼会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-13T00:30:00Z","to":"2016-06-13T01:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"资源与环境工程学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"李丽慧","affiliation":"中国科学院地质与地球物理研究所","bio":"李丽慧，女，中国科学院地质与地球物理研究所副研究员，研究生导师。现为国际工程地质与环境学会岩土体结构性委员会（IAEG-C29）秘书长，中国第四纪科学研究会应用第四纪专业委员会副主任委员，中国岩石力学与工程学会青年工作委员会委员，中国地质学会工程地质专业委员会青年工作委员会秘书长、副主任委员。主要研究方向为：古工程中的岩石力学问题：岩石长期强度、边坡及洞室长期稳定性问题；岩体（石）风化速率问题；页岩非均质性及微观力学等。参与撰写专著1部，发表论文60余篇。主持国家基金3项，中科院战略性先导专项子课题1项，中国博士后基金1项，参与多项国家自然科学基金（重点）基金项目，院创新性方向项目等多项课题。获中国地质学会“第十四届青年地质科技奖－银锤奖”、中国岩石力学与工程学会科学技术奖一等奖和中国地质学会2011年度、2015年学术年会优秀论文奖等。","position":"副研究员","img":""},"subtime":"2016-08-05T07:37:21Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57a442349ed5dbc2a8c0f551","type":0,"title":"The minimal polynomial of sequence obtained from componentwise linear transformation of linear recurring sequence","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"安徽","address":"合肥工业大学数学学科楼三楼310室报告厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-12T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"数学学院","school":"合肥工业大学","address":"安徽省合肥市"},"abstract":"Let S be a linear recurring sequence with terms in GF(q^n) and T be a linear transformation of GF(q^n) over GF(q).

“清华大学大数据能力提升项目”，一经发出反响火爆。截至2016年4月5日，该项目共招收学生共177名，其中硕士89人，博士88人，分别来自学校23个院系。2016年7月，数据科学人才培养平台建设项目获得了“清华大学研究生院工作创新奖”。\n\n那么，\n清华的大数据教育的创新之处在哪里？\n学科设计是什么样的？\n优势和特色是什么？\n就业前景如何？\n\n在2016级清华大学大数据人才培养项目报名前夕，我们采访到了清华大学数据科学研究院管委会委员、公管学院孟庆国老师，数据院管委会委员和教育指导委员会委员、交叉学院徐葳老师，数据院俞士纶院长和清华大数据产业联合会会员单位“功典科技”的首席执行官夏雨农。针对大家普遍感兴趣的几个问题，他们分别多角度地阐述了清华大学的大数据研究生教育理念。\n\n为什么只招收研究生？\n\n孟庆国老师认为，大数据能力的培养不是单一学科能做好的，应构建多学科综合交叉的教育体系。清华大学的“大数据硕士项目”由校内7院系协作共建，研究生分别来自23个院系，这充分体现了大数据人才培养的多学科综合交叉“格局”。这种“格局”要求学生既要有工程、人文、社科等相关专业学科背景，同时又要有计算科学、信息技术等学科的基础知识。只有这样才能更好地理解大数据的概念、掌握大数据的方法，在与专业的融合中学习和应用好大数据。将来自不同学科的学生吸纳到这个跨学科的人才培养平台上，正式清华大学“大数据硕士项目”的鲜明特色之一。\n\n清华大数据教育的特点是什么？\n\n“让学术更学术、让专业更专业”。俞士纶院长介绍到，数据院创造性的人才培养体现在实行价值塑造、能力培养、知识传授“三位一体”的培养模式，这是清华大数据教育特点。笔者解读：贯彻数据科学研究院“RONG”的理念，不断促进“融合”“ 包容”，实现跨学科、跨领域、跨应用的产学研结合。\n\n以徐葳老师任课的《大数据系统基础》为例，学生存在“众口难调”的情况——他们分别来信息类和非信息类的学生。为此，该课历经两轮创新，变革课堂教学的模式，将信息和非信息类不同学科背景的学生混合编组。每个小组合作完成一个实际的大数据项目。这需要小组成员先了解客户需求、并以此需求提供解决方案，最终实现开发产品的可视化。在此过程中，学生们不仅完成了大数据教学任务，还扩展了跨学科跨领域的知识，培养团队协作能力，“相互学习相互促进，效果非常好”。同时，学生们还可以接触来自业界的真实数据，了解到“这些数据如何对接数据应用场景，从而开发出真正落地的数据产品。”\n\n清华大数据教育的优势是什么？\n\n从学科建设上，问题引导、社科突破、商科优势、工科整合的学科设计。徐葳老师特别强调说：“我们不是要培养IT supporter。数据科学是一种思维方法，我们更关注于它能否用于解决别的领域的问题”。因此在大数据的课程融合了大数据思维与技能、跨界学习、实操应用相结合的大数据课程体系，不在某个技术和算法上发力，而是给学生提供全面的大数据思维能力和实践能力的培养。结合《大数据系统基础》课程教学，徐葳老师透露，今年将更早地向社会开放征集项目和企业导师，已达成上述目标。\n\n孟庆国老师从大数据治理的角度，还分享了《大数据治理与政策》课程的宗旨和目标：让学生能够利用大数据理念和方法，处理公共管理和公共政策中的问题，理解和创新公共管理和公共决策的机制；培养学习者的大数据思维，对大数据推动公共管理变革和创新应用，有更深入的认识和系统的理解；学会应对大数据带来的可能风险、安全及隐私等问题，处理好大数据本身带来的公共治理问题。\n\n孟庆国老师还强调，《大数据治理与政策》的教学将更依赖于案例分析，让学生深度认知大数据治理与政策问题。孟庆国老师也向我们透露，本学期也将开展更多从大数据应用场景出发的“应用·创新”系列讲座，并对全校学生开放。(更多大数据学科介绍，请查询数据科学研究院官网“人才培养”-“教学体系”专题）。\n\n从业界合作上，依托业界联盟。徐葳老师坦言《大数据系统基础》的难点是需要学生与来自业界的“客户” 交流，了解业界的真实需求，用好真实数据。而这些真实需求和真实数据依托的是清华大数据产业联合会的130多家企业和160多位大数据从业者。截止到目前，数据科学研究院已与SAS、IBM、汤森路透、苹果公司、Facebook和Cloudera等多家知名公司建立合作平台。\n\n从科研上，创新为要，协同发力。数据科学研究院成立以来，其推动跨界融合的理念与行动得到了清华大学众多院系的认同与支持。俞士纶院长介绍到，数据科学研究院已与众多院系合作建立了大数据研究中心。（更多可查数据科学研究院官网首页“科研机构”专题）。并产生了初步成果：工业大数据研究中心于2015年4月将开发的平台应用于三一重工装备大数据平台，成功替换Oracle数据库；经济金融大数据研究中心的“清数-银联智策指数”与2015年5月在彭博社（Bloomberg）经济信息终端上线，成为实时研究中国经济的重要指标之一；科技创新大数据研究中心自主研发面向科技大数据深度挖掘的“研究者社会网络挖掘与搜索系统”：Aminer并被微软公司用于科技搜索；遥感大数据研究中心建设了“天地空海数据平台”，部分高分数据产品已经上线，满足清华校内外产学研的长远需求。\n\n如何真正将这门学科落地？就业前景如何？\n\n清华大数据产业联合会会员企业功典科技的CEO夏雨农先生表示，业界对人才的渴求看重两点：技术和态度，在招聘时，会更注重态度的考量。希望招收的学生拥有对不同知识的好奇心和“跨界”、“包容”的态度。以“功典科技”为例，现阶段其发展目标是要落地应用好所积累的数据，需要数据科学人员与前端销售和后端技术支持的融洽配合。高等学府对业界的人才输送目前处于供不应求的状态。但企业在招聘时，会着重考虑学生“看见数据在哪里、数据价值、诠释问题、落地解决”的能力。他建议走技术路线的大数据学生“要明确技术是必须具备的能力，同时提升沟通和理解问题的能力。”，而数据科学研究院通过案例教学、讲座和RONG论坛提供给了学生深刻理解市场痛点的机会，同时通过项目教学锻炼学生的团队协作能力和表达能力，让学生听得懂、正确解读、表达观点。夏总还建议走社科路线的大数据学生在准备职业规划时，要“培养数据思维，充分涉猎统计学科相关知识，树立数据思维观念，由点及面，要能看到全景。”而数据科学研究院合班教学的方式正提供了这样的平台。\n\nhttp://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAxMzA2MDYxMw==&mid=2651558307&idx=1&sn=088c3f0e1e47b44b9bc16052fe72d63b&scene=1&srcid=0829t4yE4Y5XDJR9qZ9eq0MB#wechat_redirect","position":"","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/act/avatar/1091/293/1391/57c4fe459ed5dbabbb070ff3.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-09-02T06:35:40Z","uid":"566f891645ce0bb16f69c2e0","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57c78ace9ed5db51c7a26728","type":0,"title":"我是谁。","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"","address":"北京大学医学部逸夫教学楼二层报告厅

But, energy and mass are two very different physical concepts; how can they be exchanged with each other? We think the key to answer this question is to realize that particles are waves in nature. Thus, particle properties like energy and momentum are related to their corresponding wave properties (frequency and wave vector). Mass is clearly a particle property, can it also be related to a wave property? Such possibility is investigated in this work. We found that mass and energy indeed share similar physical nature in the wave perspective. Both of them are related to the curvature of bending the vacuum medium during the propagation of the excitation wave. This similarity allows them to be convertible.\n\nReprint: http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=64053","speaker":{"name":"张东才","affiliation":"香港科技大学","bio":"台湾大学理学士（物理），美国 莱斯大学（Rice University）物理学硕士和博士。曾任美国贝勒(Baylor)医学院 助理教授及副教授，香港科技大学 教授及讲座教授。曾任客座教授（Visiting Professor）在北京大学（1981）与清华大学（1986）讲学；并曾在加州大学圣地亚哥分校（1996）与钱永健教授合作研究。现任香港科技大学 荣休讲座教授(Professor Emeritus)及特聘教授（Adjunct Professor）。其它经历包括：香港科学会 院士(Fellow)，香港科技大学“跨学科论坛”召集人，香港生物物理学会 会长，香港科学会 理事及副会长，亚洲生物物理学会 理事，香港科技大学 教务委员会(Senate)委员，及校董会(Council)成员。北京《科技导报》编委，日本《生物物理》期刊副编辑。美国 全美华人协会Houston分会 会长等等。\n\n张教授的研究兴趣很广，包括：宏观科学研究，生物物理，量子物理等等。张教授出版了三本专著；学术论文超过一百篇（包括Nature, Science, PNAS, Biophys J等），并拥有近二十项国际专利。","position":"Professor","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/act/avatar/741/834/420/57c7ebbc9ed5dbc2a505b198.jpeg"},"subtime":"2016-09-06T08:01:46Z","uid":"566f891645ce0bb16f69c2e0","edited":false,"activityLike":["54f5112e45ce1bc6d563b8d9"]},{"id":"57c8298f9ed5dbc2a505bbaa","type":0,"title":"测地流的遍历性和部分双曲动力系统的非稠密轨道","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"信息楼343研讨室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国人民大学","address":""},"abstract":"非正曲率曲面上测地流关于Liouville测度的遍历性是一个著名的公开猜想，我们介绍如何在给定条件下来证明这个猜想。在报告的第二部分，我们讨论任意部分双曲微分同胚下的非稠密轨道，主要结果是那些具有非稠密轨道的初始点形成的集合具有满Hausdorff维数。","speaker":{"name":"吴伟胜","affiliation":"","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-01T13:13:51Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57c8298f9ed5dbc2a505bbab","type":0,"title":"Feasible Method for Semi-Infinite Programs","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"信息楼343研讨室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T08:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国人民大学","address":""},"abstract":"A new numerical method is presented for semi-infinite optimization problems which guarantees that each iterate is feasible for the original problem. The basic idea is to construct concave relaxations of the lower level problem, to compute the optimal values of the relaxation problems explicitly, and to solve the resulting approximate problems with finitely many constraints. Theconcave relaxations are constructed by replacing the objective function of the lower level problem by its concave upper bound functions. Under mild conditions, we prove that every accumulation point of the solutions of the approximate problems is an optimal solution of the original problem. An adaptive subdivision algorithm is proposed to solve semi-infinite optimization problems. It is shown that the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker points of the approximate problems converge to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker point of the original problem within arbitrarily given tolerances. Numerical experiments show that ouralgorithm is much faster than the existing adaptive convexification algorithm in computation time.","speaker":{"name":"王树雄","affiliation":"","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-01T13:13:51Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57c8298f9ed5dbc2a505bbac","type":0,"title":"The Many Faces of Sequence Data Processing","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"信息楼四楼417"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-20T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-20T07:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国人民大学","address":""},"abstract":"Sequence data, also known as data streams, play an important role in data analytics research as well as Computer Science in general.

In a broad sense, big data collected over time can be deemed as sequence data. A common type of analytical query over streams is pattern matching, also known as complex event processing.A few complexities must be dealt with for real-world sequence data. For example, it may be produced at a high rate by unreliable devices and/or communicated through wireless networks (hence the data has noise). Moreover, patterns may need to take into consideration diverse semantics including parallel sub-patterns and graph structures. In this talk, I will describe a few lines of work we have carried out in the past few years on this topic. For pattern semantics, I discuss a few variants: subsequences, extended regular expressions, parallel and interleaving patterns, and subgraph-with-timing patterns.

fruitful approach to the study of material culture. But to what extent can biographical writing still matter in an age of digital media where data structures and algorithms seem to undermine its very logic of representation. This seminar will develop a case for cultural biography as a useful framework for examining digital culture. I will begin by tracing the historical roots of this approach within a heterogeneous mix of anthropological traditions of material culture studies, British science and technology studies, and North American media studies. I will argue that while such traditions articulate very different epistemological and ontological foundations for the biographical approach, they all provide important insights into conducting research on the material and symbolic assemblages that constitute contemporary digital media culture. Part of the work that remains to be done is in broadening the scope and deepening the definition of biography — literally ‘life writing’ — so that it can develop into a richer methodological reality

evangelist）的使用要追溯到苹果电脑销售部门的盖伊•川崎（Guy Kawasaki），最早是他将该词的宗教意涵用以指称一种热情的行为：“它[布道]是销售的最纯粹和最狂热的形式，因为你销售的是梦想，而不是有形的物品。”尽管现在“布道师”仍被一些公司用作正式的岗位名称，但是，这个术语已经常被用来描述因热爱软件而向他人推广软件之设计与使用的任何人（Borreguero et al. 2015）。  传统上，学者对软件设计师和软件用户做了区分，但是，软件布道师的出现，使这一区分变得更为复杂，因为软件布道师是“有权力的用户”，通过他们的评论和演示可以确保一款软件产品的成功。一些学者承认，他们类似创业者的形象对于数字媒体社交网络的重要性，但是，这种思路将他们作为英雄般的个体加以呈现，而很少关注建构了技术想象及其“扩散的政治”（Beer 2013）的权力关系。确切地说，要问的是，软件布道师对软件的热忱多大程度上对与软件本身并无直接关联的象征价值秩序进行了再调解（remediate）。  本讲座以软件布道现象为主要研究对象，将沿着以下两个思路展开：  1. 像培训手册、网站、在线授课视频这样的媒体形态如何将软件布道师与软件纳入其中？  2. 软件布道师的形象是否经由他/她所热衷的软件范畴之外的想象而来？如果是，那么又是如何赋予这种形象以象征权力？  基于文化传记（cultural biography）的研究方法（Lesage 2015），勒萨日教授正在对过去25年来Adobe Photoshop的软件布道师进行研究，本次讲座将呈现其截至目前的研究发现。

 末句用东汉名将班超的典故。班超一生在西域征战三十年，暮年垂老时上疏请归，有“臣不敢望到酒泉郡，但愿生入玉门关”二句。此后，文人习惯将玉门关视为胡汉分界的标志、华夏国门所在。王建《秋夜曲》云：“玉关遥隔万里道，金刀不剪双泪泉。”王建用“玉关”简称来串联起玉门关两端的万里道路，若不是运送美玉之路，路上关口怎能叫玉关？李益干脆用“入关”二字概括从外部进入玉门关。无论是为“丝绸之路”命名的德国人李希霍芬，还是著有《佛教征服中国》的荷兰汉学家许里和，都不曾推敲过玉门关得名的中国原因。在他们眼中，玉门关只是丝路或佛路上一个普通站点而已。本土的交通要道就这样被外国人在殖民时代用欧洲人的视角加以命名为“丝路”。  玉门关与这条文化大通道上运输的玉石真的无关吗？  本着对本土文化自觉和重建中国话语的初衷，2014年6月至2016年2月，中国文学人类学研究会先后组织九次玉石之路田野考察，驱车总里程约二万公里，聚焦河西走廊及其两端的古代交通路线，尝试弄清和相对复原古代西玉东输的“路网”。这八次考察始于山西大同盆地至雁门关一带，那是先秦时代西来文化的进关路线及关口，直到明代时其关口位置略有变动；终于新疆的若羌、且末、于田、和田、墨玉县，那是昆仑山连接阿尔金山及河西走廊的主要运玉路线站点，上古时期沿塔克拉玛干沙漠南缘分布主要绿洲所在。在那里，分布着一系列的早期佛教遗迹：如和田地区民丰县的尼雅佛寺、民丰县东南的安迪尔佛寺、若羌县东北罗布泊西岸的楼兰佛塔、尉犁县东南孔雀河边的营盘佛寺和佛塔、若羌县城东70公里处的米兰佛寺佛像，等等。2003年新疆考古工作者在罗布泊南面古城遗址发现古墓，发掘出一件彩绘佛像的绢衣。问题随之而起：中国玉石之路的田野考察为什么自始至终都在发现玉石的同时，与佛教和石窟寺佛像不期而遇呢？自新疆和田至中原的数千公里的漫长路途中，华夏本土信奉的神圣信仰表现为物质化的玉石及其运输路线，而外来的佛教信仰则表现为佛教建筑及以佛陀为中心的巨型偶像塑造。后者更加具有艺术化的观赏性，以至于今人在欣赏自龟兹克孜尔石窟、敦煌莫高窟、张掖马蹄寺石窟、武威天梯山石窟，永靖炳灵寺石窟，天水麦积山石窟，一直到山西大同云冈石窟和河南洛阳龙门石窟的整个佛教造像衍生系列时，几乎没有人意识到石窟佛像传播所走过的路线，原来就是西周以来日益繁忙的运送和田玉给中原国家统治者的玉石之路。  在这一条近四千公里的传播路线上，自新疆南疆到敦煌和河西走廊的佛像传播主要是皈依佛教信仰的印欧语系民族如月氏人完成的；而自武威天梯山石窟到大同云冈石窟这一千多公里的传播，则是由北魏统治者拓拔氏完成的。大同当时就是北魏的国都平城，随着从平城到洛阳的迁都行为，洛阳龙门石窟的开凿原来还是拓拔氏的贡献！  早在夏王朝以前的尧舜时期，新疆的和田玉就通过印欧语系的大月氏人，输送到中原国家。我们据此判断玉石之路上西玉东输的历史有约四千年，相比佛路和丝路的两千年，确实有大传统与小传统之巨大差别。问题在于，为什么在同一条道路上传播玉石的人和传播佛教的人，主要都是非华夏民族之印欧人种的分支呢？这是一个十分耐人寻味的问题。汉武帝派张骞出使西域的目的就是联合大月氏，共同对付强敌匈奴人。虽然联合月氏的初衷没有实现，但这件史实至少可以表明：中原华夏国家与游牧在西北的印欧人种的关系，要大大好于和北方草原新崛起的游牧族匈奴人。如果还要进一步追问其所以然，那么目前除了玉石之路大传统的存在以及活跃在此路上的不同人种间因互利互惠而达成“化干戈为玉帛”之和谐关系以外，还没有什么更恰当的解释。  中国式的和平理想表达方式为什么自古就以“化干戈为玉帛”这样一句尽人皆知的成语来呈现？来自深厚的中国历史经验的民族团结理念，还有比这更实在更精当的表达吗？迄今还没有过，今后恐怕也不会有。","speaker":{"name":"叶舒宪","affiliation":"上海画报出版社","bio":"叶舒宪，中国社会科学院文学研究所研究员，中国社科院研究生院教授、博士生导师，中国比较文学学会副会长，中国文学人类学研究会会长，中国神话学会会长。1993起年享受政府特殊津贴。1997首批入选国家百千万人才工程。曾先后荣获霍英东青年教师研究奖、第一、第二届全国高校人文社会科学研究优秀成果奖等重大奖项，受聘为耶鲁大学讲座讲授、英国学术院、牛津大学、剑桥大学访问教授。叶舒宪先生在比较文学、文学人类学研究等方面的研究处于国内领先地位，曾在《中国比较文学》、《文艺争鸣》、《上海文论》等刊物开辟个人专栏，其倡导的文学人类学研究已在国内形成声势可观的新流派。由其主持的中国古典的现代阐释学术工程，在国内外产生了重要反响，被认为是中西学术结合的一种范例，建树卓越，自成一体。已经出版了《文学与人类学》、《中国神话哲学》、《神话意象》、《现代性危机与文化寻根》等专著、译著20多部，先后在《北京大学学报》、《哲学研究》、《文艺研究》、《文学评论》等期刊发表论文200余篇。

The basic idea is to construct concave relaxations of the lower level problem, to compute the optimal values of the relaxation problems explicitly, and to solve the resulting approximate problems with finitely many constraints. Theconcave relaxations are constructed by replacing the objective function of the lower level problem by its concave upper bound functions. Under mild conditions, we prove that every accumulation point of the solutions of the approximate problems is an optimal solution of the original problem. An adaptive subdivision algorithm is proposed to solve semi-infinite optimization problems. It is shown that the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker points of the approximate problems converge to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker point of the original problem within arbitrarily given tolerances. Numerical experiments show that ouralgorithm is much faster than the existing adaptive convexification algorithm in computation time.","speaker":{"name":"王树雄","affiliation":"","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-02T09:08:43Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57c9419b9ed5dbd506b77315","type":0,"title":"The Many Faces of Sequence Data Processing","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"信息楼四楼417"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-20T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-20T07:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国人民大学","address":""},"abstract":"Sequence data, also known as data streams, play an important role in data analytics research as well as Computer Science in general. Such data are prevalent: texts, biological sequences, ECG signals, time series, traffic sensory data, business and server logs, smartphone and social network data are just a few examples. In a broad sense, big data collected over time can be deemed as sequence data. A common type of analytical query over streams is pattern matching, also known as complex event processing.A few complexities must be dealt with for real-world sequence data. For example, it may be produced at a high rate by unreliable devices and/or communicated through wireless networks (hence the data has noise). Moreover, patterns may need to take into consideration diverse semantics including parallel sub-patterns and graph structures. In this talk, I will describe a few lines of work we have carried out in the past few years on this topic. For pattern semantics, I discuss a few variants: subsequences, extended regular expressions, parallel and interleaving patterns, and subgraph-with-timing patterns. I also describe some algorithmic techniques to efficiently match the complex events in real time.","speaker":{"name":"Tingjian Ge","affiliation":"Lowell大学","bio":"Tingjian Ge is an associate professor in the Computer Science Department of the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.

Empirical study based on real PoI datasets verifies our theoretical observation that the quality of top-k results in spatial keyword queries can be greatly improved through only a few rounds of interactions.","speaker":{"name":"郑凯","affiliation":"澳大利亚昆士兰大学","bio":"郑凯博士现为澳大利亚昆士兰大学计算机与电子工程系讲师。他在2012年被澳大利亚昆士兰大学授予计算机科学博士学位。郑凯博士主要研究如何为企业，科研和个人应用提供大数据管理，整合和分析的高效解决方案。他的主要研究领域包括社交媒体数据分析，时空数据库，不确定数据库， 数据挖掘和生物信息学。郑凯博士在CCF A类顶级国际期刊和会议上发表了超过40篇文章。他曾任APWeb 2016的程序委员会主席，SIGMOD （2015，2016），CIKM（2014，2015）程序委员和多个顶级期刊如IEEE TKDE， VLDB Journal和Geoinformatica的专家评审。郑凯博士是2013年澳大利亚优秀青年科研奖和2015年ICDE最佳论文奖的获得者。","position":"博士","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-02T09:10:00Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57c941e89ed5dbd506b77325","type":0,"title":"测地流的遍历性和部分双曲动力系统的非稠密轨道","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"信息楼343研讨室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国人民大学","address":""},"abstract":"非正曲率曲面上测地流关于Liouville测度的遍历性是一个著名的公开猜想，我们介绍如何在给定条件下来证明这个猜想。在报告的第二部分，我们讨论任意部分双曲微分同胚下的非稠密轨道，主要结果是那些具有非稠密轨道的初始点形成的集合具有满Hausdorff维数。","speaker":{"name":"吴伟胜","affiliation":"","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-02T09:10:00Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57c941e89ed5dbd506b77326","type":0,"title":"Feasible Method for Semi-Infinite Programs","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"信息楼343研讨室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T08:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国人民大学","address":""},"abstract":"A new numerical method is presented for semi-infinite optimization problems which guarantees that each iterate is feasible for the original problem. The basic idea is to construct concave relaxations of the lower level problem, to compute the optimal values of the relaxation problems explicitly, and to solve the resulting approximate problems with finitely many constraints. Theconcave relaxations are constructed by replacing the objective function of the lower level problem by its concave upper bound functions. Under mild conditions, we prove that every accumulation point of the solutions of the approximate problems is an optimal solution of the original problem. An adaptive subdivision algorithm is proposed to solve semi-infinite optimization problems. It is shown that the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker points of the approximate problems converge to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker point of the original problem within arbitrarily given tolerances. Numerical experiments show that ouralgorithm is much faster than the existing adaptive convexification algorithm in computation time.","speaker":{"name":"王树雄","affiliation":"","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-02T09:10:00Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57c941e89ed5dbd506b77327","type":0,"title":"The Many Faces of Sequence Data Processing","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"信息楼四楼417"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-20T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-20T07:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国人民大学","address":""},"abstract":"Sequence data, also known as data streams, play an important role in data analytics research as well as Computer Science in general.

In a broad sense, big data collected over time can be deemed as sequence data. A common type of analytical query over streams is pattern matching, also known as complex event processing.A few complexities must be dealt with for real-world sequence data. For example, it may be produced at a high rate by unreliable devices and/or communicated through wireless networks (hence the data has noise). Moreover, patterns may need to take into consideration diverse semantics including parallel sub-patterns and graph structures. In this talk, I will describe a few lines of work we have carried out in the past few years on this topic. For pattern semantics, I discuss a few variants: subsequences, extended regular expressions, parallel and interleaving patterns, and subgraph-with-timing patterns.

The entanglement of these two states, the topological superconducting state, will give rise to even more exotic quantum phenomena. While many materials are found to be either a superconductor or a topological insulator, it is very rare that both states exist in one material. Here, we demonstrate by first-principles theory as well as scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments that the recently discovered ‘two-dimensional (2D) superconductor’ of single-layer FeSe also exhibits 1D topological edge states within an energy gap of ~40&#8201;meV at the M point below the Fermi level. It is the first 2D material that supports both superconducting and topological states, offering an exciting opportunity to study 2D topological superconductors through the proximity effect.This talk is based on Nature Materials (2016) [doi:10.1038/nmat4686].About the speaker: Professor Feng Liu is the Department Chair of MSE in University of Utah, and the \"Thousand Talents Plan\" visiting professor in Tsinghua University.

Graphene is the best known 2D material and is a zero-band gap semiconductor. However, there are a whole family of 2D materials that offer different properties to graphene, such as direct band gap semiconductors and insulators. These new 2D materials are set to expand the capability beyond what graphene alone can achieve and drive 2D materials into industry. In this talk I will discuss the recent work on monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS2 and WS2), which are direct band gap semiconductors that emit light in the visible spectrum. These are grown directly onto silicon wafers using scalable chemical vapour deposition methods with single crystal sizes up to 0.5mm. These TMDs have large exciton binding energy and enable the observation of trions and biexcitons using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Interactions with defect states will also be discussed. I will discuss our recent work on heterostructures of different 2D materials, formed by vertical stacking or lateral stacking, creating new systems with engineered excitonic dynamics for photodetectors, transistors, and light emitting devices fabricated at the nanoscale. Atomic resolution studies of defects in TMDs is studied using aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy, where single sulfur vacancies are detected and their dynamics of aggregation tracked in real time. I will show how we can probe substitutional dopants and adatoms that play major roles in n-type doping of transistors and enhanced catalytic properties. This talk will cover the aspects of TMDs from synthesis, characterization to implementation in nanoscale devices for wafer-scale electronics.\n","speaker":{"name":"Jamie H.

Of these three, the CP phase is the most difficult to be measured precisely and important for distinguishing flavor symmetries. I will first review the status of CP measurement and then introduce a new proposal with muon decay at rest (muDAR). Currently, accelerator neutrino experiments such as T2K, NOvA, and DUNE are the most promising for CP measurement. Nevertheless, they suffer from several problems of degeneracy, efficiency, sensitivity, and theoretical armbiguities such as non-unitarity mixing (NUM) and non-standard interaction (NSI). The situation can be improved by adding a muon decay at rest (muDAR) source. With T2(H)K running in neutrino mode and muDAR in anti-neutrino mode, both using the same detector, the CP measurement becomes more precise can break the degeneracy between \\delta and 180^o - \\delta. Most importantly, muDAR can guarantee the CP sensitivity against NUM and NSI. The same configuration can also apply to next-generation medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments like JUNO and RENO-50, enhancing their physics potential from just mass hierarchy to also CP. With only one source and no extra detectors, this dessign is much better than DAEdLAS which requires 3 sources, but only 20% duty factor and 4 times higher luminosity for each.","speaker":{"name":"Dr. Shao-Feng Ge","affiliation":" Max Planck Institute - Heidelberg, Germany","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-03T03:40:29Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57ca462d9ed5dbbf09f1a208","type":0,"title":"第一原理分子动力学及强关联理论计算方法进展","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学蒙民伟科技大楼S727会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-08T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-08T10:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"化学系李隽课题组","address":"清华大学蒙民伟科技大楼S727会议室"},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"高兴誉 ","affiliation":" 中国工程物理研究院","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-03T03:40:29Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57ca462d9ed5dbbf09f1a209","type":0,"title":"材料院《材料科学论坛》：First-Principles Studies of the Mechanical Properties of Transition Metal Alloys\n","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学材料学院（逸夫技术科学楼1－205）"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-13T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-13T10:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"材料院《材料科学论坛》联系人：万春磊 老师 ","address":"清华大学材料学院（逸夫技术科学楼1－205）"},"abstract":"AbstractPredicting the mechanical strength and ductility of transition metal alloys remains challenging because these depend on a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this talk I will discuss two recent examples to illustrate how first-principles calculations can be used to yield new insights into both types of factors, and provide strategies for alloy design. We will consider first the ideal tensile strength and corresponding intrinsic ductility for group 5 and 6 metal-based refractory alloys forming with body-centered cubic (bcc) structures. Group 6 metals, such as Mo and W, are intrinsically brittle, and this limits their applications. Our first-principles calculations show that alloying group 6 transition metals with group 4 or 5 transition metals can transform these materials into ones that display intrinsically ductile behavior. Remarkably, this transformation in ductility can be understood as an electron filling effect with the intrinsically ductile response the manifestation of a Jahn-Teller distortion. The second example will be devoted to hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Ti, where it is known that very small concentrations of O interstitials can induce significant strengthening, but with the detrimental effect of lowering toughness. To provide new insights into this long-studied problem, we performed first-principles calculations to analyze the interactions between interstitial atoms and screw dislocation cores in hcp-Ti. Both indirect studies of generalized stacking fault energy and direct investigate of dislocation core show that oxygen and other large interstitials are strongly repelled by the screw dislocation core. This repulsion would forces these interstitials to “diffuse” from their original interstitial site during dislocation slip. The origin of this repulsion is the low symmetry structure of hcp lattice: in the hcp-Ti screw dislocation core, the interstitial volume is largely reduced. The results are shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations derived from in-situ small-scale mechanical tests.References:1.L Qi, DC Chrzan, “Tuning Ideal Tensile Strengths and Intrinsic Ductility of bcc Refractory Alloys,” Physical review letters, 112 (11), 115503 (2014).2.Q Yu, L Qi, T Tsuru, R Traylor, D Rugg, JW Morris, M Asta, DC Chrzan, A Minor, “Origin of dramatic oxygen solute strengthening effect in titanium,” Science, 347 (6222), 635-639 (2015)3.L Qi, T Tsuru, M Asta, DC Chrzan, “Interactions between Oxygen Interstitial and -Type Screw Dislocations in alpha-Titanium” (arXiv:1502.05129 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci])CV_Liang_Qi.pdf","speaker":{"name":"Liang Qi","aid":"562a971345cedb3398936a1d","affiliation":"Department of Materials Science and Engineering,University of Michigan,Ann Arbor","bio":"Liang Qi’s research fields are investigations of the mechanical and chemical properties of materials by applying theoretical and computational tools, including first-principles calculations, atomistic simulations and multiscale modeling.

However, the newest chip-based assays that interrogate hundreds of thousands of SNPs and examine individual genotypes remain expensive and most GWA studies are therefore being conducted in developed countries. GWA studies of populations in the developing world may help to identify new variants associated with disease because many developing countries have unique population genetic compositions and environmental exposures that differ from developed countries. A promising strategy that allows geneticists to carry out cost-effective GWA studies in developing countries is the pooled GWAS in which DNA samples from cases and controls are separately pooled and genotyped on single chips. Results are presented from a pooled GWAS aimed at identifying SNPs influencing lung cancer susceptibility in the population of Northern Thailand (which has a high incidence of lung cancer relative to other regions). Our study used the Illumina Infinium Human660W Quad BeadChip. I will describe some of the statistics used for comparing SNP allele frequencies in cases versus controls as well as methods for eliminating chip- or pooling-based artifacts. About a dozen \"SNPs of interest\" were identified that appeared to differ in frequency between cases and controls with p-values ranging from 10^(-3) to 10^(-8). Several of the identified SNPs have been previously associated with cancers or are linked to genes with a known role in cancer. The total cost of this study was orders of magnitude less than an individual genotype-based study.   －－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－ 欢迎光临！","speaker":{"name":"Bruce Rannala","affiliation":"美国加州大学戴维斯分校","bio":"","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-03T14:34:39Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57cadf7f9ed5dbbf09f1b0f3","type":0,"title":"Identification of Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for System Autoimmune Disease Using High-throughput Genomics and Proteomics Technologies","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"中国科学院北京基因组研究所六楼会议室 －－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－ 欢迎光临！"},"time":{"from":"2013-09-17T20:00:00Z","to":"2013-09-17T21:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院北京基因组研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Quanzhen LI Associate ssor","affiliation":"of Immunology and Internal Medicine Vice Director of Microarray Core Facility University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center","bio":"Dr. Quanzhen LI Associate Professor of Immunology and Internal Medicine Vice Director of Microarray Core Facility University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center","position":"副教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-03T14:34:39Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57cadf809ed5dbbf09f1b0f4","type":0,"title":"The New Radiobiology: Extranuclear and Extracellular Effects of Ionizing Radiation","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"中国科学院北京基因组研究所11楼会议室（1104房间）   －－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－－ 欢迎光临！"},"time":{"from":"2013-10-18T02:00:00Z","to":"2013-10-18T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院北京基因组研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Tom K.

Important areas to develop include mapping allergenic food proteins, monitoring food fraud in complex food matrices, and for monitoring early signs of infections in large scale livestock production platforms.Moreover, farm animals present a very interesting resource as novel model organisms in biomedical research, hence open source tools like PeptideAtlas and SRMAtlas are in large demand, but lagging behind compared to the state for human and classic model organism proteomes.This talk will present our work with building resources for veterinary proteomics, using a combination of shotgun and targeted proteome methods.

In a broad sense, big data collected over time can be deemed as sequence data. A common type of analytical query over streams is pattern matching, also known as complex event processing.A few complexities must be dealt with for real-world sequence data. For example, it may be produced at a high rate by unreliable devices and/or communicated through wireless networks (hence the data has noise). Moreover, patterns may need to take into consideration diverse semantics including parallel sub-patterns and graph structures. In this talk, I will describe a few lines of work we have carried out in the past few years on this topic.

This will aim to give an overview of the ongoing research in the Architecture and Synthesis of Integrated Nanostrctures (ASIN) group in Trinity College Dublin.In the first part of the talk, recent advances in post-growth modification and applications of CVD-grown graphene will be discussed. This will include the fabrication of graphene-Si Schottky barrier diodes[1], transfer printing of CVD graphene to intentionally introduce periodic ripples[2] and the assembly of diffusion barriers through the stacking of multiple large-area graphene sheets[3]. The second part of the talk will focus on the synthesis of TMD films by thermally assisted conversion (TAC) of predeposited metal layers. 2D TMDs, often thought of as semiconducting analogues of graphene, have moved to the foreground of the research community owing to their fascinating properties which make them of great interest for both fundamental studies and emerging applications. TAC is a method which shows promise for the scalable and industry-compatible synthesis of these materials[4]. The production of an assortment of TMDs by TAC, including MoS2 and WSe2, will be outlined and their high-quality demonstrated using an array of characterization techniques including Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The potential of TAC derived TMDs for various applications in the realm of electronics and energy will be discussed. The fabrication of high-performance gas sensors, consisting of MoS2 channels, with room temperature detection limits in the ppb range for NH3 will be described in detail[5]. The fabrication of large-scale heterojunction diodes, formed by transferring n-type MoS2 onto p-type Si, will be outlined. The obtained p-n heterojunction diodes exhibit notable photoconductivity which can be tuned by modifying the thickness of the MoS2 layer[6]. Additionally, a novel catalyst platform for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), consisting of MoS2 (or other TMDs) grown directly on top of a carbon electrode, will be discussed[7]. TAC synthesis, characterization and potential applications of exotic TMDs, beyond the commonly reported sulfides and selenides of Mo and W, will be discussed.Finally, the synthesis of high-quality TMDs by a true CVD processes using a microreactor and liquid-phase exfoliated precursors will be detailed[8]. The use of Raman spectroscopy, and in particular low-frequency Raman spectroscopy, to characterize these materials will be outlined[9].

The reaction mainly proceeds via intermediate 8Be states. The interaction between any two of the three α particles provides events with one, two or three 8Be interfering levels, with strong enhancement in the α–α coincidence yield. Evidence of three 8Be levels within the same 3α event suggests that one α particle is exchanged between the other two. This is a condition for Efimov states to occur in nuclei, for which no observation exists yet. The hyperspherical formalism for the low-energy three- body problem has been applied to point out the 3αparticle correlation. I also discuss experimental observations of nuclear fermionic and bosonic components displaying different behaviors in the decay of hot Ca projectile-like sources produced in mid-peripheral collisions at sub-Fermi energies. This may support the existence of a Bose Einstein condensation phenomena in heavy ion collisions. By means of quantum fluctuation analysis techniques, temperatures and mean volumes per particle as seen by bosons and fermions separately are correlated to the excitation energy of the reconstructed system. The obtained results are consistent with the production of dilute mixed (bosons/fermions) systems, where bosons experience a smaller volume and a higher energy density as compared to the surrounding fermionic gas. Our findings recall phenomena observed in the study of Bose condensates and Fermi gases in atomic traps despite the different scales.","speaker":{"name":"A.

The basic idea is to construct concave relaxations of the lower level problem, to compute the optimal values of the relaxation problems explicitly, and to solve the resulting approximate problems with finitely many constraints. Theconcave relaxations are constructed by replacing the objective function of the lower level problem by its concave upper bound functions. Under mild conditions, we prove that every accumulation point of the solutions of the approximate problems is an optimal solution of the original problem. An adaptive subdivision algorithm is proposed to solve semi-infinite optimization problems. It is shown that the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker points of the approximate problems converge to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker point of the original problem within arbitrarily given tolerances. Numerical experiments show that ouralgorithm is much faster than the existing adaptive convexification algorithm in computation time.","speaker":{"name":"王树雄","affiliation":"","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:27Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dbf9ed5db69277a3938","type":0,"title":"Research on the Nano-Bio Interfaces: New Design and New Properties","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"嘉定园区学术活动中心多功能厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T07:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T08:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海应用物理研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"王强斌","affiliation":"中国科学院","bio":"王强斌，博士，研究员。1992-1999年就读于中国石油大学，分别获学士和硕士学位，2002年于华东理工大学获博士学位。2002-2004年在上海交通大学任讲师，2004-2006年在美国亚利桑那州立大学化学与生物化学系从事博士后研究，2006-2008年在美国亚利桑那州立大学生物设计研究院任助理研究教授，2008年7月年加入中科院苏州纳米所，任研究员，课题组长，2010年获中科院“百人计划”择优支持。2012年获得首届江苏省杰出青年基金资助，2014年获得中科院“百人计划”结题优秀和国家杰出青年基金资助。现任中科院纳米-生物界面重点实验室主任，上海科技大学特聘教授，中国科学院大学岗位教授，Nano Research编委。主要研究内容包括：无机半导体纳米晶可控制备及其在光电、催化等领域中的应用研究；生物大分子指导的离散纳米结构自组装及其光学性质研究；活体荧光影像技术在疾病诊疗、药物筛选以及干细胞再生医学等领域中的应用研究。    相关新闻","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:27Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dc09ed5db69277a3939","type":0,"title":"Science and Technology with MeV Photons","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"张江园区行政楼109室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-11T01:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-11T02:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海应用物理研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Chary Rangacharyulu","affiliation":"and Osaka University","bio":"Dr. Rangacharyulu\\'s main research interests: Nuclear and Elementary Particle Physics, Quantum Chaos, Conceptual Foundations of Physics and Physics Education.Nuclear and Elementary Particle Physics: The main interests in this research are unraveling structure and symmetry informations in the sub-atomic world. This work is carried out in collaboration with research groups in Darmstadt (Germany), National High energy Physics Laboratory(KEK), Tsukuba (Japan) and Osaka University, Osaka, Japan. The research is hardware and software intensive and the main activities involve developments of radiation detector assemblies and the ancillary electronic arrangements to accomplish the physics goals. The main experimental facilities are the following: a) the three spectrometer system of the A1 collaboration at the 855 MeV electron accelerator (MAMI) at Mainz, Germany; b) 130 MeV superconducting electron accelerator (S-DALINAC) at Darmstadt; and c) 12-sector superconducting toroidal spectrometer at the 12GeV Proton Synchrotron at KEK. At Mainz, we experiment to examine the role of isobar components in the nuclear ground states. At KEK, we are carrying out a high-precision test of the validity of time reversal symmetry. We employ secondary beams of K+ mesons for this purpose. Our group will be heavily involved in the developments of equipment for the polarized tagged photon beams of 1-3.5 GeV at the 8-GeV Super Photon ring (SPring-8) in Japan.Quantum Chaos: Unlike the case of classical chaos, the signatures of onset of Quantum chaos are subjects of much discussion. Even the choice of appropriate observables and the correspondence to the classical chaos is unclear. We investigate this phenomenon in macroscopic and microscopic system. We examine the signatures for quantum chaos in phenomena such as channeling radiation, nuclear level systematics and transition strengths and also in the modes of excitation of superconducting microwave cavities. This work is carried out in collaboration with nicht-linieaire dynamik groups in Darmstadt.Conceptual Foundations of Physics and Physics Education:: Contrary to popular belief, the basic concepts of physics lack clarity and become very fuzzy at the fundamental level. It is likely that the reductionism principle fails to provide a satisfactory, coherent description of physics phenomena. The foundational bases and limits of validity of concepts of particle-wave duality, space-time and constituents of matter and interactions are investigated. The implications of these aspects to the physics education are of considerable interest.","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:28Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dc09ed5db69277a393a","type":0,"title":"The Many Faces of Sequence Data Processing","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"信息楼417"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-11T02:21:00Z","to":"2016-04-11T03:21:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国人民大学","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Tingjian Ge","affiliation":"Lowell大学","bio":"Tingjian Ge is an associate professor in the Computer Science Department of the University of Massachusetts, Lowell.

Due to the non-conservation of axial charge, the inclusion of axial charge in hydrodynamic equations is a subtle issue. On one hand, axial charge is generated by fluctuation owing to its non-conservation, on the other hand, the non-conservation also provide mechanism of charge dissipation. A more appropriate treatment is to use stochastic hydrodynamics for axial charge. In this talk, I will discuss two sources of non-conservation: topological transition and quark mass. Both of them will contribute to the fluctuation and dissipation of axial charge.","speaker":{"name":"林树","affiliation":"中山大学","bio":"2004年本科毕业于北京大学物理学院技术物理系，2010年博士毕业于美国纽约州立大学石溪分校，研究课题是AdS/CFT对偶在夸克胶子等离子体中的应用。2010-2012年在慕尼黑马普物理研究所任博士后。2012-2015年在美国布鲁克黑文国家实验室任博士后。2015年9月加入中山大学天文与空间科学研究院。","position":"博士","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:31Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dc39ed5db69277a3942","type":0,"title":"Fluoroalkanesulfenzmides and fluoroalkylthiolations: A fluorinated love story!","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"2号楼第一会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-20T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-20T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海有机化学研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Thierry BillardUniversity Claude Bernard-Lyon","affiliation":"University Claude Bernard","bio":"Prof. Thierry BillardUniversity Claude Bernard-Lyon 1","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:31Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dc49ed5db69277a3943","type":0,"title":"关于人民医院专家来校举办讲座的通知","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"学院路校区离退休教职工活动中心三层多功能厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-21T01:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-21T02:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国政法大学","address":""},"abstract":"“警惕动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病，管理胆固醇”  另有50份小礼品相送，先到先得，送完为止！   校医院 离退休工作处 2016年4月11日","speaker":{"name":"杨素敏","affiliation":"人民医院老年内科","bio":"杨素敏，副主任医师，1989年毕业于北京医科大学医疗系，获医学学士学位，毕业后就职于北京大学人民医院副主任医师，从事老年内科临床工作,积累了丰富的临床经验。","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:32Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dc49ed5db69277a3944","type":0,"title":"Using Organic Chemistry to Solve Biological Problems","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"君谋楼二楼第一会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-21T08:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海有机化学研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Rudi Marquez Department","affiliation":"Liverpool University","bio":"Professor Rudi Marquez Department of Chemistry Xi\\'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:32Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dc49ed5db69277a3945","type":0,"title":"Fluorine Transfer to Alkyl Radicals","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"君谋楼第一会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-25T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-25T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海有机化学研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Glenn Sammis Department","affiliation":"Professor Glenn Sammis Department of Chemistry University of British Columbia Vancouver","bio":"Professor Glenn Sammis Department of Chemistry University of British Columbia Vancouver, Canada","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:32Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dc59ed5db69277a3946","type":0,"title":"Overview and Outlook for Searches of Chiral Effects in Heavy Ion Collisions","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"嘉定园区学术活动中心307室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-26T03:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-26T04:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海应用物理研究所","address":""},"abstract":"Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) can form topological domains to due non-Abelian nature of the Quantum Field Theory.

Beta function is usually measured from the amplitude of a BPM signal. It is difficult and time-consuming to calibrate the BPMs precisely in terms of the gain and tilt error. On the other hand, betatron phase is equivalent to beta function and can be obtained from the turn-by-turn BPM signal. The measured phase is not affected by the BPM gain and tilt error.At NSLS-II it was found that the measurement precision of the phase is 1mr, which corresponds to 0.25% beta beat. The phase error can be corrected similarly using a response matrix, and a 5mr (rms) residual phase error can be achieved on the NSLS-II storage ring within half-an-hour. This high precision algorithm can be applied to other measurements, such as calibration of sextupoles and local impedances. A brief introduction to NSLS-II and the recent activities will be presented as well.","speaker":{"name":"W. Guo","affiliation":"","bio":"W.

When a short, high energy beam passes between two such plates—that comprise a device that we call a “dechirper”—wakefields will be induced that generate a negative chirp, i.e. one with the tail of the beam at lower energy than the head. Recently the so-called RadiaBeam/LCLS dechirper was installed and tested in the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC. This was the first time a dechirper has been tested at high energies (4.4 - 13.3 GeV), with short bunches (10’s of fs), and on an operating FEL.In my talk I will discuss the theory of the dechirper and present results from the commissioning studies at the LCLS. Time-resolved measurements of both longitudinal and transverse wakefields were performed and compared with simulations.In addition, we demonstrated flexible control of the LCLS FEL bandwidth for hard and soft X-rays. Finally, taking advantage of the strong transverse wakes of the dechirper, novel methods were devised for operating the FEL in self-seeding and two color modes.","speaker":{"name":"Karl Bane","affiliation":"Tufts University","bio":"Karl Bane Studied undergraduate at Tufts University, graduate at Stanford.

We have developed a research program to investigate the actinide-ligand binding and the electronic structures of actinide species using anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrospray ionization is used to produce solution-phase actinide molecules and multiply-charged anions in the gas phase, whereas the laser-vaporization supersonic molecular beam technique is used to generate low-oxidation state actinide-containing molecules and clusters. Photoelectron spectroscopy of negatively charged ions yields electron affinities and electronic structure information about neutral species.

The presentation follows these fundamental interactions towards controlling laser processes in various 3D geometries that enable highly functional and compact devices to form with the benefits of 3D seamless integration in delicate glass fibers through to thin films. In one approach, strong nonlinear interactions are demonstrated to align with Fabry-Perot interference fringes and generate narrow nano-length scale plasma zones of 20 to 45 nm thickness that follow the predicted /2nfilm fringe spacing in SiNx and SiOx film. Micro-disk explosions are shown to cleave open the film into sub-wavelength internal cavities at single or multiple periodic depths or to eject fractional film segments at controllable depths. This new form of high-resolution patterning is aimed at new directions of writing multilevel micro- or nano-fluidic channels for lab-in-a-film, film coloring, 3D surface patterning, nanofluidics, capacitor trimming, and nano-optic fabrication. This new opportunity holds promise to further improve the functionality of CMOS microelectronics and photonics, photovoltaics, MEMS, LED, lab-on-a-chip devices where thin films are widely deployed during their manufacture.Femtosceond laser processing is further adapted to write 3D optical circuits within the fiber cladding and present a practical means for coupling light efficiently with the fiber core waveguide. Modification of the core waveguide further enables tuning of the modal properties, enabling multi-mode interferometers to be embedded in-fiber for various applications in power tapping, spectral filtering and polarization tuning. Chemical etching of laser-generated nanogratings are also applied to embed microfluidic channels, micro-optical devices and optical resonator components in arbitrary positions in the fiber. The laser writing overall provides a flexible integration of fiber-cladding photonics and microfluidics on which to build 3D opto-fluidic microsystems in our common base of optical networks through to compact biomedical probes. The approach promises to reduce fabrication and packaging costs and to enable highly functional all-fiber microsystems for optical communications, fiber lasers, and sensing. Examples of integrated approaches in lab-in-a-fiber devices and smart medical catheters are presented.","speaker":{"name":"Peter R. Herman","affiliation":"加拿大多伦多大学","bio":"Peter R. Herman received the B.Eng. degree (1980) in Engineering Physics at McMaster University. He earned MASc (1982) and PhD (1986) degrees studying lasers and diatomic spectroscopy in the Physics Department at the University of Toronto that followed with a post-doctoral position at the Institute of Laser Engineering in Osaka University, Japan (1987) to the study of laser-plasma physics and x-ray lasers. He joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto in 1988 where he holds a full professor position. Professor Herman directs a large and collaborative research group that develops and applies laser technology and advanced beam delivery systems to control and harvest laser interactions in new frontiers of 3-D nanofabrication. Our mantra is: “We begin with light and we end with light devices.” To this end we are inventing new methods for processing internally inside optical materials that carve out highly compact and functional lightwave circuits, microfluidics, optofluidic systems, biophotonic sensors, and smart medical catheters. Our end goals are inventing new manufacturing processes and extending optical device and Lab-on-a-chip concepts towards more compact Lab-in-a-fiber and Lab-in-a-film microsystems. Professor Herman is OSA fellow, holds several patents, spun out one company (FiLaser), and has published over 300 papers in journals and conference proceedings.","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:49Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dd59ed5db69277a396e","type":0,"title":"New Aspects of Enantioselective Catalysis by Chiral Brønsted Acids and Bases","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"君谋楼第一会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-01T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-01T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海有机化学研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Masahiro Terada Department","affiliation":"Graduate School of Science","bio":"Prof. Masahiro Terada Department of Chemistry,  Graduate School of Science,  Tohoku University, Japan","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:11:49Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35dd59ed5db69277a396f","type":0,"title":"High Brightness Beam from Laser-Triggered Injection in Plasma Wakefield Accelerators (PWFA) as a Driver of 5th Generation Light Source","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"多功能厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-01T02:30:00Z","to":"2016-06-01T03:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海光学精密机械研究所","address":""},"abstract":"Recent plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) experiments have successfully shown the high-gradient and high efficiency acceleration of either electrons or positrons [1, 2, 3].

Many studies have demonstrated that normally distributed data in practice are rather an exception, especially when data are collected longitudinally. Estimating a model without considering the nonnormality of data may lead to inefficient or even incorrect parameter estimates. Therefore, robust methods become very important in growth curve modeling. Among the existing robust methods, the two-stage robust approach (Yuan & Zhang, 2012) from the frequentist perspective and the semiparametric Bayesian approach (Tong, 2014) from the Bayesian perspective are promising. The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of the two approaches through a Monte Carlo simulation study on a linear growth curve model, by varying conditions of sample size, number of measurement occasions, population distribution, existence of outliers, covariance between the latent intercept and slope, and variance of measurement errors. Simulation results show that both approaches provide more accurate and precise parameter estimates than the traditional growth curve modeling when the normal assumption is violated. The semiparametric Bayesian approach performs better when data come from a mixture of normal distributions. If data are normal, the two approaches estimate the model as well as the traditional growth curve modeling. A real-data example based on the analysis of a dataset from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort is also provided to illustrate the application of the two robust approaches.","speaker":{"name":"Tong Xin","affiliation":"","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:00Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35de19ed5db69277a398d","type":0,"title":"From a schizophrenia candidate gene to genome scan","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"Rm A0405, Lecture Hall, Biological Research Building.."},"time":{"from":"2016-06-23T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-23T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海生命科学研究院","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Hong Kong University","affiliation":"Hong Kong University of Science and TechnologyHost PI","bio":"Hong Xue, Ph.D. Professor Hong Kong University of Science and TechnologyHost PI: Dr. Mu-Ming Poo","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:01Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35de19ed5db69277a398e","type":0,"title":"人民医院专家讲课通知","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"北京","address":"研究生院离退休教职工活动中心三层多功能厅。"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-24T01:30:00Z","to":"2016-06-24T02:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国政法大学","address":""},"abstract":"“清晨血压与脑卒中——您应该知道的秘密”。  校医院 离退休工作处 2016年6月13日","speaker":{"name":"马继顺","affiliation":"北京医学院","bio":"马继顺，副主任医师，副教授。1975年毕业于北京医学院医疗系，现为人民医院心内高血压科副主任医师。多年来从事内科临床工作，积累了丰富的临床经验，擅长高血压、冠心病、心律失常、高血脂、动脉硬化等疾病的诊疗工作，尤其擅长重症高血压及高血压急症的处理。","position":"副教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:01Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35de29ed5db69277a398f","type":0,"title":"Guardian Molecules in Inflammatory Brain Diseases","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"Rm A0405, Lecture Hall, Biological Research Building.."},"time":{"from":"2016-06-24T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-24T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海生命科学研究院","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Jia-Wei Zhou","affiliation":"Pediatrics Stanford University U","bio":"Lawrence Steinman, Ph.D. Chair and Professor of Neurology & Pediatrics Stanford University U.S.A.Host PI: Dr. Jia-Wei Zhou","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:02Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35de29ed5db69277a3990","type":0,"title":"System for Ultra-high Resolution Digital X-ray Imaging: Goal: 3-5 mm at clinically acceptable dose","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"第五会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-27T08:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海光学精密机械研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"Ted Morse","affiliation":"Brown University","bio":"","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:02Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35de29ed5db69277a3991","type":0,"title":"The Power of Integration: Biophysics of Estrogen Receptor","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"102楼234"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-29T05:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-29T06:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海应用物理研究所","address":""},"abstract":"Accurate determination of multiprotein complexes such as estrogen receptor has been challenging for high-resolution structural techniques.

While the technology of Computational Intelligence (CI) has been playing a vital role with this regard, there are still a number of challenges inherently manifesting in these problems.To prudently address these challenges, in this talk, we introduce a concept of information granules embracing a plethora of formal constructs such as intervals (sets), fuzzy sets, rough sets, etc. We highlight an emergence of higher type and higher order information granules in the analysis and synthesis of granular models. The fundamental problem that becomes central to all investigations is concerned with the formation of information granules. We elaborate on the principle of justifiable granularity and discuss its role as a key design vehicle facilitating a construction of information granules realized on a basis of available experimental evidence (which could be either numeric or granular).We elaborate on a number of conceptual and design issues of granular models. In particular, it is demonstrated that granular models developed on a basis of existing numeric models of CI lead to their substantial augmentations and result in interesting and comprehensive ways of evaluation of their performance. Two general approaches under investigation are associated with a formation of granular parameter spaces and granular output spaces. The proposed assessment of the quality of the model embraces two generic criteria, namely a coverage criterion of experimental data and a specificity criterion. It is shown that a hierarchy of information granules gives rise to granular models both of higher type and higher order.The detailed investigations are focused on selected problems including rule-based models and building auto-encoders in architectures of deep learning.","speaker":{"name":"Witold Pedrycz","affiliation":"University of Alberta","bio":"Witold Pedrycz is Professor and Canada Research Chair (CRC) in Computational Intelligence in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

However, its practical usage is often limited by the path explosion problem, that is, the number of explored paths usually grows exponentially with the increase of program size. In this talk, we argue that for the purpose of fault detection it is not necessary to systematically explore the paths. We propose a new symbolic execution approach to mitigate the path explosion problem by predicting and eliminating the redundant paths based on symbolic values. Our approach can achieve the equivalent fault detection capability as traditional symbolic execution without exhaustive path exploration. In addition, we develop a practical implementation called Dependence Guided Symbolic Execution (DGSE) to soundly approximate our approach. Through exploiting program dependence, DGSE can predict and eliminate the redundant paths at a reasonable computational cost. Our empirical study shows that the redundant paths are abundant and widespread in a program. Compared with traditional symbolic execution, DGSE only explores 6.96% to 96.57% of the paths and achieves a speedup of 1.02X to 49.56X.","speaker":{"name":"杨子江","affiliation":"美国研发中心","bio":"杨子江博士现任西密西根大学计算机科学系教授。他1996年于中国科技大学计算机系获得学士学位，1999年于美国赖斯大学计算机科学系获得硕士学位，2003年于美国宾夕法尼亚大学计算机与信息科学系获得博士学位。杨博士目前主要从事软件测试及验证领域的研究。迄今为止发表了六十余篇论文(包括CCF推荐A类论文十一篇和B类论文二十篇)及十项美国专利。他获得2008年度ACM TODAES 最佳期刊论文奖, 2008年西密西根大学工学院青年学者奖，2010 PADTAD最佳会议论文奖，2015年谷歌计算机 Engagement奖，和2015年西密西根大学工学院研究成就奖。杨子江博士是国际电子电气工程师协会（IEEE）资深会员，并担任过密西根大学电子与计算机科学系访问教授，NEC 公司美国研发中心科研顾问，美国自然科学基金评委，美国宇航局博士后评委，美国能源部科技企业基金评委等职。","position":"教授","img":"http://info.ruc.edu.cn/userfiles/teacher/20160706064102289.png"},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:04Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35de49ed5db69277a3997","type":0,"title":"Radio observations of the gamma-ray sources detected with Fermi","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"Room 701"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-08T02:30:00Z","to":"2016-07-08T03:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海天文台","address":""},"abstract":"The orbiting Fermi observatory discovered 3000 point gamma-ray sources. The majority of them, 56% were confirmed as AGNs, a fraction of sources was associated with pulsars, supernova remnants, but approximately 1/3 of them are unassociated and their nature remains mystery. Nowadays, we have catalogues with millions and billions objects in optical, UV, IR, radio and other frequencies. Probably, the most remarkable achievement of astronomy for last 100 years is that the nature of all these objects was revealed. We do know what they are: stars, galaxies, gas clouds, cosmic microwave background, etc. The phenomenological picture of the observed Universe has been built. Although some exotic objects may have been missed or mis-identified, but en masse, the nature of objects in the Universe that emit electromagnetic waves seemed to have been established. Discovery of Fermi observatory has shattered this belief. I will present results of dedicated all-sky radio astronomy observations that have goals a) analysis of the population of gamma-ray loud radio sources, b) a search for associations of remaining 1/3 of gamma-ray sources.

Since TPP first came out as a novel technique over a decade ago, a great number of diverse micro-objects have been fabricated using TPP with a variety of effective two-photon chromophores. In TPP, when a near-infrared ultrashort-pulsed laser is closely focused into a volume of photocurable resins, real 3D microstructures can be fabricated using a layer-by-layer accumulating technique; therefore, TPP is considered to be a promising technique for 3D nano/microfabrication. Recent reports have shown that the spatial resolution of TPP is achieved at approximately the sub-100 nm scale over diffraction limit of incident light. In this lecture, our attempts to improve the resolution and fabrication efficiency of nano/ microfabrications based on TPP are presented. In addition, incorporating inorganic nanoparticles with superior optical and electronic properties into polymeric 3D microstructures is a popular method for achieving optoelectronic components like waveguides and photonic crystals. In-situ generation of silver nanoparticles as well silver coating of microstructures have been studied for the incorporation of silver into microstructures. To incorporate semiconductor quantum dots into microstructures we have pursued a surface functionalization strategy. Cadmium selenide (CdSe) as well as core-shell CdS/ZnS, CdSe/ZnS and CdSe/ZnSe were functionalized with photosensitive monolayer to make them solution processable and photopatternable. The core-shell nanoparticles show more efficient flourecence and can be useful in display applications. These functionalized quantum dots can be easily dispersed in photopolymerizable resins to fabricate 3D structures.","speaker":{"name":"Kwang-Sup Lee","affiliation":"Hannam University","bio":"Professor Kwang-Sup Lee received the Ph.D. degree in polymer chemistry from Freiburg University, Germany, in 1984.

JuSPARC stage 1 is dedicated to photon generation up to the hard x-ray regime for condensed matter research in order to investigate electronic, spin, and lattice responses on sub-picosecond timescales. These timescales are particularly relevant for electronic phase transitions, ultrafast demagnetization, or local redox processes during resistive switching, which will be studied by means of spectroscopy, microscopy and scattering techniques.

The potential applications of these materials have inspired strong interests in understanding the physical mechanisms underlying their structural, dynamical and mechanical properties. In this talk we present hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations of supramolecular networks formed by unentangled telechelic chains with sticky end monomers of finite functionality. We study the kinetics of sticky monomer association, the topological structure and the resulting dynamic and rheological behavior of the supramolecular systems as a function of the sticker bonding energy and the parent polymer chain length in equilibrium and under shear and planar extensional flows.In equilibrium state percolated transient networks are formed above a threshold bonding energy around 4.3kBT. At high bonding energies (³10kBT), the majority of the stickers are fully reacted and the fraction of open stickers is less than 1%. We find the dynamical and rheological behavior of such strongly associated supramolecular networks are dominated by a partner exchange mechanism in which the stickers exchange their associated partners, and so release the imposed topological constraints, through the association and disassociation of sticker clusters. The characteristic time of the partner exchange events grows exponentially with the bonding energy and is up to 2 orders of magnitude longer than the average sticky bond lifetime. As a result, three relaxation regimes, namely the initial Rouse, intermediate rubbery and terminal relaxation regimes, can be clearly distinguished in the stress and chain end-to-end vector relaxation functions. A phantom chain hopping model based on the microscopic understanding is proposed to describe the chain relaxation dynamics in the supramolecular networks.A shear hardening behavior of the strongly associated supramolecular networks is observed in startup shear with shear rates above the inverse of the average sticky bond lifetime. These systems also demonstrate much stronger extensional hardening behavior than their polymer melt counterparts in the startup planar extensional flow. The startup flow hardening can be well interpreted by the non-Gaussian stretching of the polymer chains in the transient networks. On the other hand, the supramolecular polymer systems we studied only exhibit shear thinning behavior in the steady states owing to the decrease in the total number of elastically effective strands in the transient networks with the increase of flow rate.","speaker":{"name":"Zuowei Wang PhD","affiliation":"University of Reading","bio":"Zuowei WangSchool of Mathematical，Physical and Computational Sciences, University of Reading, Associate Professor.

Only about 40 L subdwarfs reported in the literatures. I have conducted a search for L subdwarf candidates within the UKIDSS and SDSS. 34 of my candidates were confirmed as L subdwarfs spectroscopically at optical and/or near infrared wavelengths with VLT, GTC and Magallen. I examined the spectral types and metallicity subclasses classification of known L subdwarfs, and established a new classification scheme of L subdwarfs. I estimate temperatures and metallicities of 22 late type M and L subdwarfs by comparing their spectra to BT-Settl models. I find that L subdwarfs have temperatures between 1500 K and 2700 K, which are higher than similarly-typed L dwarfs by around 100-400 K depending on different subclasses and subtypes. I constrained the metallicity ranges of subclasses of M, L and T subdwarfs. I also discussed the spectral type and absolute magnitude relationships for L and T subdwarfs. Then I will briefly introduce two of my observational programme on L subdwarfs. I followed up 18 L subdwarfs with X-shooter on the VLT for more detailed model comparison and radial velocity measurements. I am leading a 3-years programme to measure parallaxes of 20 L subdwarfs with the 10.4m GTC telescope (comparing only 6 L subdwarfs have parallaxes in the literature). This programme is involving 123 hours of GTC time, and completing in a year.

However, the overall structural architecture, ion permeation and gating mechanisms of Piezo channels have remained unknown. Here we determined the medium-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the full-length (2,547 amino acids) mouse Piezo1 (Piezo1). Piezo1 forms a trimeric three-bladed, propeller-shaped structure with a putative central pore module that resembles the pore architecture of other trimeric channels such as the acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1), and peripheral regions composed of the extracellular ‘blade’ domains, ~12 apparently resolved peripheral helices (PHs) in each subunit and intracellular ‘beam’ and ‘anchor’ domains. Using chimeras, site-directed mutagenesis, and substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM), we functionally validated the miniature pore-forming module of Piezo1 that encodes the essential pore properties. We further identified the pore-lining helix and specific residues within the pore module that determine unitary conductance, pore blockage and ion selectivity for divalent and monovalent cations and anions. Remarkably, the non-pore-containing peripheral region of Piezo1 confers mechanosensitivity to ASIC1. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Piezo proteins consist of distinct and separable modules responsible for ion conduction and mechanical force sensing/transduction to co-ordinately fulfil their function as sophisticated mechanosensitive cation channels.肖百龙简历.docx","speaker":{"name":"肖百龙","affiliation":"清华大学","bio":"","position":"研究员","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:15Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35def9ed5db69277a39b5","type":0,"title":"Assembling global neural networks of the mouse brain","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"Rm A0405, Lecture Hall, Biological Research Building"},"time":{"from":"2016-08-29T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-08-29T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海生命科学研究院","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"USC Mark","affiliation":"USC Mark and Marry Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute","bio":"Hongwei Dong, Ph.D. Associate Professor USC Mark and Marry Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute & Department of Neurology Keck School of Medicine of USC University of Southern California U.S.A.Host PI: Dr. Zi-Long Qiu","position":"副教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:15Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35def9ed5db69277a39b6","type":0,"title":"藤仓-凌云光纤激光与传感应用技术交流会","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"光机所1号楼多功能厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-08-31T01:00:00Z","to":"2016-08-31T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海光学精密机械研究所","address":""},"abstract":"为解决光纤激光和传感行业中的这些关键难题，推动光纤激光器和光纤传感行业的再上台阶。凌云公司基于对光纤激光和光纤传感行业应用的深刻理解，以及多年来在光纤激光和传感行业中的光纤处理工艺经验积累，特举办2016年度“藤仓-凌云光纤激光与传感应用技术交流会“上海光机所专场交流，诚挚地邀请您光临并参与我们的交流。会议议程 :","speaker":{"name":"程雯婧、陈德玺","affiliation":"","bio":"","position":"","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:15Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35df09ed5db69277a39b7","type":0,"title":"Glassy Spin Dynamics in Buckled Colloidal Crystal","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"嘉定园区学术活动中心102房间"},"time":{"from":"2016-08-31T06:30:00Z","to":"2016-08-31T07:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海应用物理研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"韩一龙","affiliation":"香港科技大学","bio":"韩一龙 博士。1998年北京大学物理系本科毕业后，在芝加哥大学攻读博士学位。之后在美国宾西法尼亚大学做博士后。2007年夏天，被香港科技大学物理系聘为助理教授。研究方向是实验软物质物理，主要用胶体颗粒作为原子模型系统研究统计物理中的一些问题，包括胶体晶体融化和结晶、椭球的布朗运动、位形温度、胶体自组装和图案形成、伊辛自旋阻错等。","position":"博士","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:16Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35df09ed5db69277a39b8","type":0,"title":"Drop floating on a thin liquid film","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"嘉定园区学术活动中心102房间"},"time":{"from":"2016-08-31T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-08-31T08:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海应用物理研究所","address":""},"abstract":"The behaviors of a droplet gently falling on a smooth solid or liquid surface are quite similar -- it can bounce, oscillate and eventually make contact with substrate. However, we identify a unique long-time floating state only appearing on liquid surface. To clarify this fundamental difference between liquid and solid, we coat solid substrate with a very thin liquid film (one-hundredth of drop diameter) and recover the long-floating state. This state requires the air gap under droplet to have perfect symmetry, and thus only appears on accurately-leveled substrate. A minute tilting as small as 0.3 degrees can break the symmetry and lead to a distinct short-lifetime state! During floating, we further reveal that air leakage under droplet is significantly affected by liquid boundary, which has rarely been considered in similar problems. More interestingly, our substrate also exhibits non-adhesive properties: a droplet can bounce thousands of times under external vibration, and skids a long distance without coalescence. This study improves the fundamental understanding of droplet-substrate interaction, and suggests a new approach to realize non-adhesive surfaces for droplet.   相关新闻","speaker":{"name":"徐磊","affiliation":"香港中文大学","bio":"","position":"教授","img":""},"subtime":"2016-09-10T01:12:16Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d35df09ed5db69277a39b9","type":0,"title":"大宗及精细化学品的生物合成技术","img":"","location":{"country":"中国","city":"上海","address":"嘉定园区办公楼310房间"},"time":{"from":"2016-09-01T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-09-01T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"","school":"中国科学院上海应用物理研究所","address":""},"abstract":"","speaker":{"name":"于波","affiliation":"中国科学院","bio":"于波，男， 中国科学院微生物研究所，微生物生理与代谢工程重点实验室，副研究员 ，微生物学博士，德国洪堡学者，中科院青年创新促进会会员。现任中国科学院-发展中国家科学院生物技术卓越中心（CAS-TWAS Center of Excellence for Biotechnology, CoEBio）副主任，中科院微生物生理与代谢工程重点实验室主任助理，中科院微生物研究所青年研究组长。研究方向为工业与环境微生物学，主要从事功能基因组学，合成生物学和代谢工程等方面的研究。2006年6月获得山东大学微生物学博士学位，并获得山东省优秀毕业生称号，同年进入中科院微生物所工作。2007年分别获得山东省和山东大学优秀博士学位论文奖，2008年入围全国百篇优秀博士学位论文提名奖。2008年获得德国洪堡基金会的资助赴德国Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research（原德国生物工程中心，GBF）和Hamburg University of Technology从事微生物功能基因组学研究工作。2010年10月回国，被中科院微生物所聘为极端微生物与工业合成生物技术青年研究组长。已承担或完成多项科研课题，在Trends Microbiol., ACS Synth.

The quest for truly universal definitions of units has led to the gradual adoption of fixed values of fundamental constants; the value of the speed of light was fixed in 1983 to define the metre. In 2018, a further revolution will take place with new definitions of the kelvin, kilogram, ampere and mole in terms of fixed values of the Boltzmann constant k, Planck constant h, fundamental charge e and Avogadro’s number NA. The seminar will chart the evolution of some of the base units, the advantages and shortcomings of their definitions and show how the present system will change in the near future. Perspectives for a future definition of the second will also be mentioned.\r\nBrief Biography：Mark Plimmer is a lecturer at the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, Paris, France. Born in England in 1964, he obtained his BSc. from Birmingham University in 1985. His doctorate at Oxford University (1985-89) was on laser spectroscopy of atomic systems (hydrogen, gadolinium, xenon). During postdoctoral work at Yale University and Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, he worked on measurements of the 1S Lamb shift in hydrogen and a determination of the Rydberg constant. After a further postdoctoral position at ENS studying parity violation in atomic cesium (1993-95), he took up his present post. From 1996-2004 he led a project to develop an optical clock based on a narrow two-photon transition in silver. During a spell in Switzerland (2004-07), he worked on the development of continuous cold atom cesium fountain clock. He was also involved in laser spectroscopy of N6+ using an electron beam ion trap via visits to Oxford University. Since rejoining the Cnam in 2007, he has worked with both the mass group where he studies surface effects using photothermal deflection, and the thermometry group working on a determination of Boltzmann’s constant. Since 2009, he has collaborated with the National Physical Laboratory, UK, on a new determination of the Rydberg constant.","speaker":{"name":"Mark Plimmer "},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:24:53Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6c8c99ed5db69277a8446","type":0,"title":"Sustainable carbon materials for renewable energy applications","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"化学工程系英士楼201会议室 "},"time":{"from":"2016-09-07T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-09-07T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学工程系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Abstract-China-Titirici.docxshort Bio -magda.docx","speaker":{"name":"Prof. Magdalena Titirici"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:24:57Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6c8cd9ed5db69277a8448","type":0,"title":"Nanocomposite membranes for water treatment and gas separation","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"化学工程系工物馆324(A)会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-09-02T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-09-02T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学工程系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Presentationflyer.pdf","speaker":{"name":"Prof. Vicki Chenthe"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:25:01Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6c8ce9ed5db69277a8449","type":0,"title":"可分解生物材料之研发：壳聚糖、聚氨酯、自修复材料","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"何添楼406会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-09-02T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-09-02T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学系危岩课题组","school":"","address":""},"speaker":{"name":"徐善慧"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:25:02Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6c8cf9ed5db69277a844a","type":0,"title":"工程物理系第181期“工物学术论坛”：核反应堆物理计算的现状和展望——讲述一个计算反应堆物理分析师自己的故事","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"清华大学刘卿楼105会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-09-02T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-09-02T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"工物系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"报告摘要：Reactor physicists are nuclear engineers who predominantly deal with the neutron physics (i.e. neutronics) aspects of a reactor and its associated components. The primary task of a reactor physicist is to predict detailed neutron behavior in a reactor during both normal operation and abnormal events. Nowadays, these missions are mainly completed via numerical modeling and simulation techniques, relying heavily on computer equipment and computational methodologies. Compared to other research areas such as thermal hydraulics and materials science, reactor physics remains as a fundamental, yet intangible, and relatively matured realm in the nuclear engineering discipline; years of accumulated understanding in physics and advancements in mathematics have achieved enormous success in solving many reactor physics problems. However, any remaining unsolved problems are generally onerous and unamiable.This talk will encompass the history and prospective future of R&amp;D endeavors in reactor physics, with a particular emphasis on the role of computational reactor physicists in the new nuclear energy era. The speaker will expand the topic with a connection to his own career development as a reactor physics practitioner, and include narratives of three interesting reactor design projects he has worked or been working on. The talk will be wrapped up with a summary of challenging and contingent research topics in computational reactor physics.\r\n报告人简介：Dr. Zeyun Wu (吴泽云) is currently Research Associate in the Department of Material Sciences and Engineering at the University of Maryland (UMD).

But, energy and mass are two very different physical concepts; how can they be exchanged with each other? We think the key to answer this question is to realize that particles are waves in nature. Thus, particle properties like energy and momentum are related to their corresponding wave properties (frequency and wave vector). Mass is clearly a particle property, can it also be related to a wave property? Such possibility is investigated in this work.

Here I will present our results on transport measurements on high mobility few-layer graphene and phosphorene devices. In bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with mobility as high as 400,000 cm2/V, we observe intrinsic gapped states at the charge neutrality point, arising from electronic interactions. This state is identified to be a layer antiferromagnetic state with broken time reversal symmetry. In another few-layer graphene system, ABA-stacked trilayer graphene consists of multiple Dirac bands, where crystal symmetry protects the spin degenerate counter-propagating edge modes resulting in σxx = 4e2/h. At even higher magnetic fields, the crystal symmetry is broken in by electron-electron interactions and the &#61550;=0 quantum Hall state develops an insulating phase with non-monotonic dependence on temperature and magnetic field. Our findings indicate the role of crystal and spin symmetry in generation of topological phases in multiple Dirac bands. At finite doping, we explore the tunable integer and fractional quantum Hall states and Landau level crossings in these few-layer systems. Finally, I will present our recent results on quantum oscillations and weak localization in air-stable, few-layer phosphorene devices. Our results underscore the fascinating many-body physics in these 2D membranes.\r\n\r\n个人简介：Chun Ning (Jeanie) Lau is a Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of California, Riverside.

The polar dielectric SrTiO3 (STO) exhibits such an energetic phonon mode and the 2DEG is created both when one unit cell FeSe layer is grown on its (100) surface and on the interface with another dielectric like LaAlO3 (LAO). We obtain a quantitative description of both systems by solving the gap equation for Tc for arbitrary Fermi energy, electron-phonon coupling and the phonon frequency, and direct (RPA) electron-electron repulsion strength. The high temperature superconductivity in 1UCFeSe/STO is possible due to a combination of three factors: high LO phonon frequency, large electron-phonon coupling and huge dielectric constant of the substrate suppression the Coulomb repulsion.\r\nPart two: We use Ginzburg-Landau theory to study the transport of 2D superconductors.

However, in contrast to ideal, defectless, single layer layer graphene, the presence of defects in graphene as well as stacking as few or multilayer assemblies changes completely the properties of these materials, converting it into semiconductor exhibiting photocatalytic properties. The initial use of graphenes in photocatalysis was as additive of semiconductors to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Latter, it was realized that graphene oxide can behave itself as a semiconductor with UV photoresponse. A natural evolution has been to develop visible light photoresponsive graphene semiconductors. In this presentation, a new procedure for defective graphene films preparation with semiconducting properties for overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial electron donor or for CO2 reduction will be shown. The process is based on the use of suitable natural polymers that can form films of nanometric thickness essentially defect-free with subnanometric roughness. Pyrolysis of these films can render few-layers graphene and even single layer graphene, depending on the concentration and speed of the spin coating employed in film preparation. If the natural biopolymer contains N or sulfur in its composition, then, the resulting graphene can be doped, with a doping content that essentially depends on the pyrolysis conditions.While graphene is a conductive material, the presence of dopant elements converts then into semiconductor and, as consequence, they undergo charge separation when they are illuminated with light of wavelength shorter than the band gap. These semiconducting doped graphenes can be used for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water in the absence of any metal.[1, 2] However, the presence of metals acting as co-catalysts increases the efficiency of the materials for hydrogen generation.In this presentation, data will be presented showing that it is possible to prepare oriented metal nanoparticles on few-layers graphene and that the resulting material has a record efficiency for the overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial electron donors.[3-5] In addition, these materials can also be useful to promote the Sabatier methanation of CO2, the photocatalytic activity being dependent on the temperature of the system.References.[1] M.

Unobstructed optical access is achieved by matching the optical refractive indices of the casing, the blade, and the working fluid. \r\nThe flow in the blade tip region is dominated by the tip leakage flow and tip leakage vortex (TLV). The leakage flow, driven by the pressure difference across the blade, passes through the narrow tip gap and emerges into the rotor passage like a jet with high axial and circumferential momentum. At the early stage, this flow separates from the casing and rolls up into the TLV near the blade suction side. Later on, the TLV detaches from the blade due to vortex-wall interaction, and the leakage flow penetrates deeply into the passage, generating a three dimensional shear layer at its interface with the forward passage flow and a boundary layer near the casing. Both of them are entrained into the TLV after the endwall boundary layer separation. \r\nTurbulence in the tip region is highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous. It is generated primarily by the shear production in the shear layer and the contraction associated with the leakage flow separation. Consequently, turbulence kinetic energy peaks at these regions, but it is also elevated in other areas such as the TLV center due to the mean flow convection and low local dissipation rate. The vortex bursting and the vortex-blade interaction alter the production and turbulence energy significantly. Moreover, the unsteady motion of large scale coherent structures forms a significant fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy in the TLV core.\r\nBrief Biography：\r\nDr. Huixuan Wu has been an assistant professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, &#8232;University of Kansas, USA, since 2015.

Existing methods are either only suitable for small scale systematic synthesis, oversimplifying the nodal dynamics, lack of performance guarantees or fail to adapt to changing environments. \r\nThis motivates our research aiming at a scalable, correct-by-construction formal design methodology for distributed cooperative systems. In particular, we focus on a formal design of multi-robot systems that can guarantee the accomplishment of high-level team missions through automatic synthesis of local coordination mechanisms and control laws. \r\nOur basic idea is to decompose the team mission into individual subtasks such that the design can be reduced to local synthesis problems for individual robots, and then solving these local synthesis problems by composing predesigned and verified reactive motion/action primitives of robots. Multidisciplinary approaches combining control theory, machine learning and computational verification are utilized to achieve this goal. \r\nThe developed theory will enable robots in the team to cooperatively learn their individual roles in a mission, and then automatically synthesize local task and mission plans to fulfill \r\ntheir subtasks. A salient feature of the proposed method lies on its ability to handle environmental uncertainties and un-modeled dynamics, as we do not require an explicit model \r\nof the transition dynamics of each agent and their interactions with the environment. In addition, the design is on-line and reactive enabling the robot team to adapt to changing environments and dynamic tasking.\r\n\r\nBio-sketch: Hai Lin is currently an associate professor at the Department of \r\nElectrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, where he got his Ph.D. in 2005.

In this epoch the Universe was dark, cold and opaque. However, it underwent a phase transition where the neutral gas was re-ionised when the first stars began to shine and the first quasars emerged. The Universe then became transparent, allowing starlight to travel through large distances and reach us. The reionisation era is one of the least understood periods in the cosmological history. It is where galaxies, like our Milky Way, were in their infancy stages, rapidly turning the gases trapped within into luminous stars. In this talk I will discuss the ionisation proecesses in the protogalaxies and their host enviroments, caused by irradiation of UV/X-rays from massive stars and accreting sources and by the bombardment of ultra-high-energy particles generated in the violent processes that are associated with star formation and accretion. I will also show how the ionisation fronts form, develop and propagate. The impacts on our understand of structual formation in the young Univserse will be discussed. \r\nBrief Biography：Prof. Kinwah Wu is the Head of Theory at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London (UCL) in UK.

The IoT wireless sensor nodes need to be maintenance free and operate continuously, which will have to rely on energy harvesting for power. In this talk, we propose online discrete rate and power adaption policies for an energy harvesting communication of IoT wireless sensor nodes. The receiver periodically sends 1-bit feedback by comparing the channel power gain with a predetermined threshold. The transmitter correspondingly adjusts QAM level and transmission power based on the 1-bit feedback and the available battery energy. To determine the optimal channel threshold, adaptive M-QAM level and corresponding power allocation, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize the throughput within a finite horizon. We further propose an efficient but suboptimal discrete rate and power policy. Our results show that the performance loss is negligible for the simple M-QAM adaption of the suboptimal policy that is attributed to the optimal choice of channel threshold.\r\n\r\n讲演者简介\r\n\r\nDr. Wei Zhang (F’15) received the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2005.

According to the modified conceptual model, the TC IR is controlled by the intensification potential (IP) and the weakening rate due to surface friction under the eyewall. The IP is determined primarily by the potential energy available for a TC to develop, which is a function of the thermodynamics of the atmosphere and the underlying ocean, and the dynamical efficiency of the TC system, which depends strongly on the degree of convective organization in the eyewall and the inner-core inertial stability of the storm. At relatively low TC intensity, the IP of the storm is often larger than the weakening rate due to surface friction, leading to an increase in the TC IR with TC intensity. As the storm reaches an intermediate intensity of 35-40 m s-1, the difference between the IP and weakening rate due to surface friction reaches the maximum, corresponding with the maximum IR. Later on, the IR decreases as the TC further intensifies because surface friction increases with TC intensity at a faster rate than the IP. Finally, the storm approaches its maximum potential intensity (MPI) when IR becomes zero. The modified conceptual model is well validated with results from observations.","speaker":{"name":"王玉清"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:28:50Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6c9b49ed5db69277a84fc","type":0,"title":"汽车系第173期学术沙龙-针对智能交通系统的电动助力转向系统开发","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"清华大学汽研所三层301会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-14T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-14T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Brief Introduction to Prof. Shirou Nakano\r\n\r\nPosition:\r\nPresident of Japanese Society of Tribologists\r\nEducation:\r\n2000 Doctor of Informatics, KYOTO UNIV.\r\nWork Experience:\r\n2015-Present Seneior Fellow, JTEKT\r\n2015-Present Director, ITS JAPAN\r\n2012-2015 Member of the Board, Chief R&amp;D Officer\r\nProfessional Memberships:\r\n2016-Present President, Japanese Society of Tribologists\r\n2014-Present Guest Professor, TSINGHUA UNIV.

His work has been featured in Nature, the Economist, Atlantic Monthly, Wired, NPR, BBC, El Pais, CNN and many other outlets.\r\nI explore how modeling the scientific process can create opportunities for improving it. I begin by demonstrating how the complex network of modern biomedical science provides a substrate on which a scientist–-and indeed science as a whole-–thinks, and its consequences for ongoing scientific discovery and human health. Using millions of scientific articles from MEDLINE, I show how science moves conservatively from problems posed and questions answered in one year to those examined in the next. Along the way, I show how contemporary science “changes its mind”; how it has become more risk-averse and less efficient at discovery; how the atmosphere of its own internal puzzles have largely decoupled it from health needs. We use this as an opportunity to demonstrate how much more efficient strategies can be found for mature fields, which involve greater individual risk-taking than the structure of modern scientific careers supports, and propose institutional alternatives that maximize a range of valuable objectives, from scientific discovery to robust understanding to technological advance.","speaker":{"name":" James Evans"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:29:00Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6c9c59ed5db69277a8508","type":0,"title":"欧美文学论坛第八期：Chinese American Transnational Writer Marilyn Chin (陈美玲) and Her intercultural Influences: A Lecture & Bilingual reading","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"Rm.116, Wennan Building"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-08T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-08T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学人文学院欧美文学研究中心，清华大学外文系","school":"","address":""},"speaker":{"name":" Marilyn Chin (陈美玲)"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:29:09Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6c9c69ed5db69277a8509","type":0,"title":"Recent advances in low-dimensional materials: carbon, metal-dichalcogenides, boron","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"液晶大楼307"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-08T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-08T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学微纳米力学与多学科交叉创新研究中心","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"摘要：Low dimensional nanostructures and material vary in chemical composition, leading to very rich spectrum of properties and behaviors.

However, it was already apparent that there were phenomena in nature that were not explained by the SM and that additional physics \"beyond the Standard Model (BSM)\" was needed. There is reason to believe that some of the BSM physics will be accessible with more data at the LHC. After describing the LHC and the CMS detector, I will discuss recent results from CMS on the search for physics beyond the SM; prospects for the data-taking period that is just starting and will last for about two more years; CERN's plan to increase the LHC luminosity (collision rate) far beyond its initial design; and the CMS collaboration's plans to upgrade the detector to handle the higher rates.\r\n\r\n报告人简介：Dr. Butler is the spokesperson of CMS experiment at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of CERN.

By using nonequilibrium Green's function method, we derive time-averaged formulism for spin transfer torques in a noncollinear magnetic tunneling system under ac modulation within wide-band-limit approximation. Using these formulas, we further investigate ac spin transfer torques in a carbon-nanotube-based magnetic tunneling system. It shows that under ac modulation, the low-bias linear (quadratic) dependence of the in-plane (out-of-plane) torque on bias still holds, and the regular angular dependence on noncollinear angle is maintained. By introducing photon-assisted tunneling, the bias-induced components of the in-plane and out-of-plane torques can be enhanced by about 10 and 80 times, respectively. Further analysis shows that optimized enhancement can be achieved by using ac driving frequency w=e0/k, k=1,2,..., where e0 marks a remote dc transmission peak, and using ac amplitude D such that D/w maximizes a kth-order Bessel function of the first kind. Out findings suggest that ac modulation is a promising way for electrical manipulation of spin transfer torques, paving the road towards emerging nanoelectronic and spintronic devices utilizing spin transfer torques.\r\n个人简介：Dr. Chen works on theoretical Physics as a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Physics at McGill University, Canada.

Lattice instabilities are deeply connected to atomic vibrations and impact functional properties in many materials, including ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, phase-change materials, and superionic conductors.Neutron and X-ray scattering and optical spectroscopy measurements can map phonon dispersions throughout reciprocal space, providing a quantitative information on the mean-free-paths of heat-carrying vibration modes, and revealing dominant scattering mechanisms, including anharmonicity, electron-phonon coupling, and scattering by defects or nanostructures. Such microscopic information about the microscopic origins of thermal transport provides important insights to design more efficient thermoelectric materials, for example. In addition, first-principles simulations of the atomic dynamics enable the rationalization of extensive experimental datasets. In particular, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations at finite-temperature allow us to capture striking effects of anharmonicity near lattice instabilities.In this presentation, I will present results from our recent investigations of phonon transport in several important thermoelectric materials (PbTe, SnTe, AgSbTe2, SnSe, Mo3Sb7, tetrahedrites) [1-6]. Further, phonons can provide a large contribution to the entropy of solid-solid phase-transitions, and I will discuss several cases where our investigations of anharmonic phonons lead to a better understanding of phase-stability, highlighting recent results on thermodynamics of the metal-insulator transition in VO2 [7] and in ferroelectric perovskites.

His doctoral thesis investigated the role of phonons and electron-phonon coupling on the entropy of crystalline solids, primarily in superconducting transition metal compounds (Louis Rosen prize for best PhD thesis at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center). After holding postdoc and research staff positions at Caltech, he became a Clifford Shull fellow in the Neutron Sciences Directorate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (2008). As a research staff in the Materials Science and Technology Division at ORNL and as co-PI on the S3TEC Energy Frontier Research Center, he initiated a program to investigate phonons in thermoelectric materials with neutron and x-ray scattering, supporting several postdocs (Drs Jie Ma, Chen Li, Jiawang Hong, Jen Niedziela, Dipanshu Bansal). He also led an ORNL-LDRD project to develop software to model inelastic scattering data from first-principles simulations. He received a DOE Early Career Award grant (2014).

Early conception of varied phases of matter as well as transitions among them, perhaps developed from e.g. burning wood and heating water. Those ancient pursuits continue into the modern quest for understanding the structure of matter under extreme conditions: what’s the phase of matter when heated to unprecedented temperature? The answer to this question relies upon our understanding of the strong nuclear force, which is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). First principle calculations of QCD predict that the normal nuclear matter, when heated to be hot enough, will change into a new phase of matter called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In fact, the QGP was an old phase of matter that occupied the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. Today, such primordial droplets of QGP can be re-created repeatedly and measured precisely in relativistic heavy ion collisions (often called the Little Bangs). Remarkable discoveries have been made at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that together reveal the QGP as a nearly perfect quantum liquid with superior opaqueness. We will discuss a number of novel properties of QGP. In particular we will highlight the recent progress on how certain unusual transport phenomena stemming from microscopic chiral anomaly, which is intrinsically quantum mechanical and could manifest themselves in the macroscopic QGP fluid. A brief survey will be given on the theoretical developments, the experimental search in heavy ion collisions, as well as the recent exciting progress of such physics in Dirac and Weyl semimetals.\r\n个人简介：Prof. Jinfeng Liao is a theoretical nuclear physicist exploring the forms of matter under extreme conditions: extremely hot, extremely dense, and extremely strongly interacting.

Using Strichartz estimates I extablish rigorous quasi-exponential stability bounds. The rate of exponential growth of energy is just one Lyapunov exponent. Numerical analysis shows that orbits with a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent exist at any (positive) nonlinearity. For stationary orbits, the full spectrum of such exponents is analytically computable. The case when the kicking period is commensurate to 2\\pi yields a perfectly well defined classical dynamical system , i.e. a measure preserving transformation on the unit sphere in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, that undergoes a transition from integrability to ergodicity as the nonlinearity is increased.

This is a deep high-dimensional generalization of the study of closed geodesics. The setting is very general, being that of Geometric Measure Theory, and the main application until very recently was the construction of minimal varieties of any dimension in a compact Riemannian manifold. \r\n\r\nIn the past few years we have discovered new applications of this old theory, including a proof of the Willmore conjecture, of the Freedman-He-Wang conjecture, and of Yau's conjecture (about the existence of infinitely many minimal hypersurfaces) in the positive Ricci curvature setting. We will give an overview of these results, describe our current efforts to develop the theory further and discuss future directions. Among the most recent developments, we will describe our work on the problems of the Morse index and multiplicity of min-max minimal hypersurfaces. Most of the material covered in these lectures is based on joint work with Andre Neves.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Speaker\r\n\r\nFernando Codá dos Santos Cavalcanti Marques is a Brazilian mathematician working mainly in geometry, topology and partial differential equations. He is a professor at Princeton University. In 2012, together with André Neves, he proved the Willmore conjecture.\r\n\r\nFernando Marques obtained his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2003, under the supervision of José Fernando Escobar. He worked at the IMPA from 2003 to 2014. On September 1, 2014, Marques joined Princeton University as a full professor.\r\n\r\nSome of his best known works are the following:\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with André Neves, the solution to the Willmore conjecture (2012).

The predictive power of MD however comes at a steep computational price, limiting the system sizes and simulation times that can be achieved in practice. While the size limitation can be efficiently addressed with massively parallel computers, the same approach cannot extend the timescales much beyond microseconds. I will discuss an alternative, parallel-in-time, strategy – the Parallel Replica Dynamics (ParRep) method – that aims at addressing the timescale limitation of MD for systems that evolve through rare state-to-state transitions. I will review the theoretical foundations of the method and demonstrate its usefulness by reviewing different examples of mate rials simulations where access to long timescales (up to 10,000 times longer than with MD alone) was essential to study the physical processes of interest.\r\n个人简介：Research Scientist in Theoretical Division T-1 (Physics and Chemistry of Materials).

Supercapacitors store electrical energy via ion electrosorption directly in the EDLs at the electrolyte-electrode interface, suggesting that such liquid-solid interfaces play a dominant role in the underlying energy storage mechanism and the resulting device performance. Because electrical energy in supercapacitors is stored based on physical phenomena rather than chemical reaction (as in batteries), supercapacitors have fast rates of charge/discharge and a virtually limitless number of charge cycles. Much of the goal of supercapacitor research is aimed at increasing the amount of energy stored (energy density is the strong point in favor of batteries), which in turn focuses attention on the electrolyte, the nature of the electrode, and the electrode-electrolyte interactions.\r\nTo date, ionic liquids (ILs) have become emerging candidates for electrolytes used in supercapacitors; meanwhile carbons are the most widely used electrode materials in supercapacitors. To improve the energy density and the transport properties of the charge carriers in supercapacitors, carbons have been developed in diverse forms such as activated carbons, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), onion-like carbons (OLCs), carbode-derived carbons and graphene. Using molecular modeling combined with molecular experimental probes, such as SAXS, SANS, NMR, and AFM, we report on our investigations into the interfacial phenomena occurring between the IL electrolytes and electrodes of varying geometries to understand the energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors that rely on EDLs established at IL-electrode interfaces.\r\n\r\n报告人介绍\r\nCummings教授1976年本科毕业于澳大利亚纽卡斯尔大学（University of Newcastle）数学系，1980年于澳大利亚墨尔本大学（University of Melbourne）获得博士学位；1980-1981年在加拿大圭尔夫大学从事博士后研究；于1983年加入美国弗吉尼亚大学化学工程系，并于1991-1993年担任教授职位。2007-2013年，Cummings教授任美国橡树岭国家实验室纳米材料科学中心首席科学家，2002年至今，任美国范德堡大学化学工程系John R.

Yet until today we don't have a good understanding of what are surely the simplest mathematical tests pertaining to their \"reality''. To be precise black holes are explicit mathematical solutions of the Einstein field equations. The certainly exist as beautiful mathematical objects but in order to correspond to physical, ``observable'', objects they have to verify certain simple to state mathematical properties such as: rigidity, stability and the possibility that they can form from reasonable initial configurations, free of black holes, - this latter is the well known problem of collapse. In my lecture I will describe these mathematical problems and give a broad overview of recent results.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Speaker:\r\n\r\n\r\nSergiu Klainerman is a mathematician known for his contributions to the study of hyperbolic differential equations and general relativity.

By utilizing the electron spin rather than charge, spintronic technologies answer this challenge by offering the opportunity to realize dissipation free data storage and logic devices. Skyrmions have recently been promoted as a low-power, highly scalable spintronic technology. These unique looped spin textures host a range of fascinating phenomena due to their topologically protected quantum state, and offer great potential for low dissipation magnetic information storage. We have recently demonstrated the realization of room temperature artificial Bloch skyrmion lattices over extended areas in their ground state by patterning asymmetric magnetic nanodots with controlled circularity on a PMA underlayer [1]. Another promising route to achieving highly energy-efficient spintronic devices is magneto-ionic control of metal/oxide heterostructures. We have demonstrated effective magneto-ionic manipulation of GdFe/NiCoO interfaces due to a redox-driven oxygen migration, manifested through the interface-sensitive exchange bias effect [2]. We further show that the magnetoelectric coupling moderated by voltage-driven oxygen migration extends beyond the interface region in relatively thick AlOx/GdOx/Co(15 nm) films [3].

Building practical quantum network calls for long coherence time and feasibly scale-up physical systems. In recent 10 years, point defects with individual controllable spins come into the focus due to their scalability, ability of interacting with photons, and long coherence times. One most promising system is the nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. In this talk, we will start by introducing the multi-qubit quantum register composed of an electron spin and several nuclear spins around, the ways to operate them and their coherence properties. By designing photonic structures, we increase the photon collection efficiency which leads to ways of high fidelity spin readout. Emission based and absorption based quantum optical interfaces are realized based on these techniques. We will discuss how to build scalable quantum networks from these two approaches. In the end, progress in other solid state qubit systems like vacancies in SiC, rare earth ion dopant in YAG crystal will be discussed. \r\n个人简介：杨森毕业于清华大学物理系基础科学班，在加州大学圣迭戈分校从事关于半导体量子阱里激子的量子现象的研究，于2009年获得物理博士学位。目前在德国斯图加特大学第三物理研究所从事基于固体点缺陷的量子光学的研究。","speaker":{"name":"杨森"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:33:18Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6cac09ed5db69277a85dc","type":0,"title":"新材料及新性能的大设计探讨","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"理科楼C109"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-28T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-28T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&低维量子物理国家重点实验室&物理系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"当前，我们正处于充满挑战和竞争时代。如何才能发现更多新材料、新特性,和新器件,这是代表全球科学研究和战略发展的趋势。本报告在总结新材料和新特性的发展前沿的基础上, 提出和讨论一些设计和研究新材料的新观点和正在尝试的新方法，以期获得新型功能材料及新的功能特性，期望对于如何设计新型电子材料，自旋电子材料，多电功能材料，或设计新型电子，自旋，光学等特性，以及对材料基因组等研究有所借鉴。 \r\n本报告也总结我们在高压诱导大幅度增加铁基超导电流及机制，Rashba BiTeCl 体系中的费米面拓扑转变的结果，silicene, 热电，及多铁材料研究的一些重要结果。 并着重讨论自旋零带半导体的新的进展，并将提出它们的一些新的物理概念及其在下一代自旋电子学中的应用。也会共同探讨一下三个材料和性能探索的终极问题。物质、材料及性能越来越复杂，还应该有更多新材料、新物质及新物质粒子、新奇异性能等存在并等待被探索。它们还有多少？它们是什么？如何找到它们？\r\n个人简介：王晓临，澳大利亚Wollongong大学，超导与电子材料研究所教授与副所长，自旋与电子材料研究组组长，澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow，澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者。\r\n山东大学物理本科及固体物理硕士，2000年在澳大利亚Wollongong大学获材料科学博士学位。曾先后在奥地利、日本、美国著名大学研究机构从事研究工作。研究领域广泛，涵盖新型功能材料的设计及其试验和理论研究、涉及超导材料、自旋电子材料、磁性铁电材料、热电材料等。尤其在新材料设计方面，在国际上首次独创提出了自旋零带半导体 (Spin gapless Semiconductors) 新型材料，已在国际上被试验和理论验证。在国际著名杂志上发表论文超过300篇，很多重要工作发表国际顶级杂志，如：Nature Materials, Science Advances, Physical Review Letters, Advanced Materials, Advanced Functional Materials等。论文引用近6000 多次。曾获得英女王伊丽莎白二世学者称号、美国材料学会和国际超导技术中心奖，和 WOLLONGONG大学校长合作奖。近年来以项目带头人身份承担了十多项澳大利亚基金项目，项目经费超过1000万澳元。现为澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow, 澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者。","speaker":{"name":"王晓临"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:33:20Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6cac29ed5db69277a85dd","type":0,"title":"高速定量磁共振生物标记物成像","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"郑裕彤医学楼D326"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-27T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-27T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"","address":""},"abstract":"报告摘要：\r\n随着国家脑计划的逐步开展和中国医疗逐渐走向精准和个体医疗阶段，对于磁共振成像技术的成像速度和成像的可靠性的要求越来越高。浙江大学脑影像科学技术中心在3T成像仪安装完成的一年中，针对在活体中的结构、功能、生理和病变过程，进行一系列成像技术研究，重点发展高时空分辨、高精度、快速、多模态参数技术，并为生理建模提供中尺度(mesoscale)的定量基础支撑。在这次讲座中我将对我们的一些初步工作作简要介绍，与清华同仁共同讨论。","speaker":{"name":"钟健晖"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:33:22Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6cac39ed5db69277a85de","type":0,"title":"Photoacoustic imaging and focusing in deep biological tissue","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"精仪系系馆4304大会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-26T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-26T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"精仪系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Abstract\r\nTaking advantage of rich molecular contrasts and safe non-ionizing radiation, optical imaging has been playing increasingly important roles in biomedical applications. However, a fundamental limit of optical imaging in biological tissue is light diffusion, which prohibits high-resolution imaging at depths beyond ~1mm. To break through this limit, Dr. Lidai Wang recently developed photoacoustic imaging and wavefront shaping technologies for in vivo functional imaging, early cancer detection, and focusing light into diffusive regimes. This presentation will first discuss the development of functional photoacoustic imaging modalities which, for the first time, achieved real-time quantitative imaging of oxygen release from single red blood cells in living tissue and enabled measurement of extremely slow blood flow in deep tissue. Then he will present a novel technique named nonlinear photoacoustic guided wavefront shaping (nonlinear-PAWS) that can effectively focus light to its diffraction limit in highly scattering media such as deep biological tissue.\r\nBiography\r\nLidai Wang received the Bachelor and Master degrees from the Tsinghua University, and received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Toronto.

I will discuss two examples to demonstrate the impact of GBs on the chemical and catalytic properties of nanomaterials. In the first example, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was used to probe epitaxial graphene and its interaction with gas molecules. I found that the GBs in graphene on Ru substrate are extremely susceptible to chemical attack by water, which can cut the graphene along GBs, followed by the intercalation of water under the graphene. This process produced a lot of graphene flakes, and I further revealed the superlubric sliding and electronic screening effect of the flakes using STM. In the second, I explored the role of GBs in metal nanoparticles for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. I prepared defect-rich metal nanoparticles using e-beam evaporation and quantified the average GB density by transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic activity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 and CO is directly correlated with GB density in metal nanoparticles. This is the first quantitative study of GB effect in electrocatalysis, and provides a new design principle for nanoparticle electrocatalysts.","speaker":{"name":"冯小峰 （Xiaofeng Feng）"},"subtime":"2016-09-12T15:33:26Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d6cac79ed5db69277a85e1","type":0,"title":"Parallel Sparse Matrix Algorithms for Large-Scale Computer Simulations","img":"","location":{"country":"","city":"","address":"FIT1-315"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-26T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-26T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"计算机科学与技术系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Abstract\r\nComputer modeling of physical phenomena plays an increasingly important role in science and engineering.

They are mathematically well described, namely by the Navier-Stokes equations and the respective boundary conditions.While the low Reynolds number regime (i.e., weakly driven systems) has been very well explored in the '80s and '90s of the last century, in the fully turbulent regime major research activity only developed in the last decade. This was also possible thanks to the advancement of computational power and improved algorithms and nowadays numerical simulations of such systems can even be done in the so-called ultimate regime of turbulence, in which even the boundary layers become turbulent. In this talk we review this recen progress in our understanding of fully developed Rayleigh-Bénard and Taylor-Couette turbulence, from the experimental, theoretical, and numerical point of view, focusing on the latter. We will explain the parameter dependences of the global transport properties of the flow and the local flow organisation, including velocity profiles and boundary layers, which are closely connected to the global properties. Next, we will discuss transitions between different (turbulent) flow states.报告人介绍：Detlef Lohse graduated from the University of Bonn in 1989 with a degree in Physics, and completed his PhD at the University of Marburg in 1992.

The all-biocompatible nature of ATPS makes them promising for cell transplant immunoisolation applications by coating and encapsulation.\r\nThis talk describes implementations of ATPS in microfluidic systems. In the first system, microparticles and cells are controllably self-assembled at an ATPS two-phase interface, and pulled across the interface by a magnetic force, to coat the assembly. The second system uses microfluidics to generate water-in-water microemulsions with a high degree of monodispersity, by both active perturbation and completely passive flow focusing methods, demonstrating utility in controlled encapsulation and release of microparticles and cells. Finally, simple mathematical models are developed to understand each fluidic process, and predict the size of the self-assembled cell clusters and the size of the generated water-in-water emulsions.\r\n机械系陈皓生老师邀请，联系方式：chenhs@tsinghua.edu.cn\r\n","speaker":{"name":"Dr. Scott S.

Yang\r\nSchool of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Oklahoma (OU), Norman, OK\r\n\r\n\r\nInterband cascade (IC) lasers take advantage of the broken band-gap alignment in type-II InAs/Ga(In)Sb quantum wells to reuse injected electrons in cascade stages for photon generation with high quantum efficiency [1]. Significant progress has been achieved in the development of high-performance IC lasers with low power consumption [2-3], which includes successful operation of an IC lasers in Curiosity Rover on Mars for detection of CH4 and commercial products for chemical sensing. Also, the IC architecture has been explored for other optoelectronic devices such as infrared photodetectors and photovoltaic cells [4-7]. Combination of interband transition and fast carrier transport in IC structures provides more flexibilities and advantages to achieve high device performance for photodetectors and photovoltaic cells. The unique features and prospects of IC lasers and relevant optoelectronic devices will be reviewed and discussed with recent experimental results.\r\n\r\n1. R. Q. Yang, at 7th Inter.

His work explores the sources, structure, dynamics and consequences of modern knowledge. Evans is particularly interested in the relation of markets to science and knowledge more broadly, and how evolutionary and generative models can inform our understanding of collective representations, experiences and certainty. He has studied how industry collaboration shapes the ethos, secrecy and organization of academic science; the web of individuals and institutions that produce innovations; and markets for ideas and their creators. Evans has also examined the impact of the Internet on knowledge in society. His work uses natural language processing, the analysis of social and semantic networks, statistical modeling, and field-based observation and interviews. Evans’ research is funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Mellon and Templeton Foundations and has been published in Science, PNAS, American Journal of Sociology, American Sociological Review, Social Studies of Science, Administrative Science Quarterly and other journals. His work has been featured in Nature, the Economist, Atlantic Monthly, Wired, NPR, BBC, El Pais, CNN and many other outlets.\r\nI explore how modeling the scientific process can create opportunities for improving it. I begin by demonstrating how the complex network of modern biomedical science provides a substrate on which a scientist–-and indeed science as a whole-–thinks, and its consequences for ongoing scientific discovery and human health. Using millions of scientific articles from MEDLINE, I show how science moves conservatively from problems posed and questions answered in one year to those examined in the next. Along the way, I show how contemporary science “changes its mind”; how it has become more risk-averse and less efficient at discovery; how the atmosphere of its own internal puzzles have largely decoupled it from health needs. We use this as an opportunity to demonstrate how much more efficient strategies can be found for mature fields, which involve greater individual risk-taking than the structure of modern scientific careers supports, and propose institutional alternatives that maximize a range of valuable objectives, from scientific discovery to robust understanding to technological advance.","speaker":{"name":" James Evans","affiliation":" Professor of Sociology, University of Chicago"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:27:01Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d780299ed5db69277a97ab","type":0,"title":"《文化素质教育讲座》（清华大学学生社团协办专场）－ 加强核安全文化建设，持续提升核安全水平（核安全文化校园行活动第六场报告会）","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"主楼接待厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-08T09:50:00Z","to":"2016-06-08T09:50:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"环境保护部核与辐射安全中心，清华大学工程物理系、文化素质教育基地、学生科协星火论坛部","school":"","address":""},"speaker":{"name":"刘华","affiliation":" 环境保护部核安全总工程师"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:27:21Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d7803d9ed5db69277a97ba","type":0,"title":"清华环境学术沙龙第290期：Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) of Nitric Oxide ---- Highlights of our Past and","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"环境节能楼119会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-04T10:30:00Z","to":"2016-06-04T10:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"院学术委员会主办","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"环境学术沙龙第290期\r\n\r\n报告题目：SelectiveCatalyticReduction(SCR)ofNitricOxide ---- Highlightsof ourPastand\r\nCurrentWork \r\n报告人：Ralph T.

This is a deep high-dimensional generalization of the study of closed geodesics. The setting is very general, being that of Geometric Measure Theory, and the main application until very recently was the construction of minimal varieties of any dimension in a compact Riemannian manifold. \r\n\r\nIn the past few years we have discovered new applications of this old theory, including a proof of the Willmore conjecture, of the Freedman-He-Wang conjecture, and of Yau's conjecture (about the existence of infinitely many minimal hypersurfaces) in the positive Ricci curvature setting. We will give an overview of these results, describe our current efforts to develop the theory further and discuss future directions. Among the most recent developments, we will describe our work on the problems of the Morse index and multiplicity of min-max minimal hypersurfaces. Most of the material covered in these lectures is based on joint work with Andre Neves.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Speaker\r\n\r\nFernando Codá dos Santos Cavalcanti Marques is a Brazilian mathematician working mainly in geometry, topology and partial differential equations.

He worked at the IMPA from 2003 to 2014. On September 1, 2014, Marques joined Princeton University as a full professor.\r\n\r\nSome of his best known works are the following:\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with André Neves, the solution to the Willmore conjecture (2012). Marques and Neves \"Min-max theory and the Willmore conjecture\" was uploaded to arXiv on February 2012, in it they solved the Willmore conjecture, using Almgren–Pitts min-max theory.\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with Ian Agol and André Neves, the solution to the Freedman–He–Wang conjecture (2012)\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with Simon Brendle and André Neves, a counter-example to the rigidity conjecture of Min-Oo (2010)\r\n\r\nHe was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) of 2010 in Hyderabad, and a plenary speaker at the ICM of 2014 in Seoul.

The predictive power of MD however comes at a steep computational price, limiting the system sizes and simulation times that can be achieved in practice. While the size limitation can be efficiently addressed with massively parallel computers, the same approach cannot extend the timescales much beyond microseconds. I will discuss an alternative, parallel-in-time, strategy – the Parallel Replica Dynamics (ParRep) method – that aims at addressing the timescale limitation of MD for systems that evolve through rare state-to-state transitions. I will review the theoretical foundations of the method and demonstrate its usefulness by reviewing different examples of mate rials simulations where access to long timescales (up to 10,000 times longer than with MD alone) was essential to study the physical processes of interest.\r\n个人简介：Research Scientist in Theoretical Division T-1 (Physics and Chemistry of Materials).

Supercapacitors store electrical energy via ion electrosorption directly in the EDLs at the electrolyte-electrode interface, suggesting that such liquid-solid interfaces play a dominant role in the underlying energy storage mechanism and the resulting device performance. Because electrical energy in supercapacitors is stored based on physical phenomena rather than chemical reaction (as in batteries), supercapacitors have fast rates of charge/discharge and a virtually limitless number of charge cycles. Much of the goal of supercapacitor research is aimed at increasing the amount of energy stored (energy density is the strong point in favor of batteries), which in turn focuses attention on the electrolyte, the nature of the electrode, and the electrode-electrolyte interactions.\r\nTo date, ionic liquids (ILs) have become emerging candidates for electrolytes used in supercapacitors; meanwhile carbons are the most widely used electrode materials in supercapacitors. To improve the energy density and the transport properties of the charge carriers in supercapacitors, carbons have been developed in diverse forms such as activated carbons, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), onion-like carbons (OLCs), carbode-derived carbons and graphene. Using molecular modeling combined with molecular experimental probes, such as SAXS, SANS, NMR, and AFM, we report on our investigations into the interfacial phenomena occurring between the IL electrolytes and electrodes of varying geometries to understand the energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors that rely on EDLs established at IL-electrode interfaces.\r\n\r\n报告人介绍\r\nCummings教授1976年本科毕业于澳大利亚纽卡斯尔大学（University of Newcastle）数学系，1980年于澳大利亚墨尔本大学（University of Melbourne）获得博士学位；1980-1981年在加拿大圭尔夫大学从事博士后研究；于1983年加入美国弗吉尼亚大学化学工程系，并于1991-1993年担任教授职位。2007-2013年，Cummings教授任美国橡树岭国家实验室纳米材料科学中心首席科学家，2002年至今，任美国范德堡大学化学工程系John R.

Yet until today we don't have a good understanding of what are surely the simplest mathematical tests pertaining to their \"reality''. To be precise black holes are explicit mathematical solutions of the Einstein field equations. The certainly exist as beautiful mathematical objects but in order to correspond to physical, ``observable'', objects they have to verify certain simple to state mathematical properties such as: rigidity, stability and the possibility that they can form from reasonable initial configurations, free of black holes, - this latter is the well known problem of collapse. In my lecture I will describe these mathematical problems and give a broad overview of recent results.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Speaker:\r\n\r\n\r\nSergiu Klainerman is a mathematician known for his contributions to the study of hyperbolic differential equations and general relativity. He is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University, a position he held since 1987. Since 2011, he is a Higgins professor of Mathematics, Princeton University. From 1980 to 1987 he was a faculty member at New York University.\r\n\r\nKlainerman is a PDE analyst with a strong interest in General Relativity. His current research deals with the mathematical theory of black holes more precisely on their rigidity and stability. He is also interested in the dynamic formation of trapped surfaces and singularities.\r\n\r\nKlainerman is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (elected 2005), a foreign member of the French Academy of Sciences (elected 2002) and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1996).\r\n\r\nHe was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1991 and Guggenheim Fellow in 1997. Klainerman was awarded the B&ocirc;cher Memorial Prize by the American Mathematical Society in 1999 \"for his contributions to nonlinear hyperbolic equations\". He is currently a Editor of Annals of Mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergiu_Klainerman\r\n\r\nhttps://web.math.princeton.edu/~seri/homepage/seri.htm\r\n\r\n","speaker":{"name":"Sergiu Klainerman","affiliation":" 普林斯顿大学希金斯讲座教授美国国家科学院院士法国科学院外籍院士美国人文与科学院院士"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:30:17Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d780da9ed5db69277a9848","type":0,"title":"Eureka:固体“宇宙”中的外尔费米子","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"理科楼郑裕彤大讲堂"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-05T04:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-05T04:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"","address":""},"abstract":"1929年德国数学家和物理学家外尔在狄拉克方程的基础上预言一种无质量的具有相反“手性”的粒子，被称为外尔费米子，但因为其违反“左右”对称性（即宇称守恒）而未被广泛接受。1957年杨振宁和李政道提出宇称不守恒后，人们很快意识到中微子就是一种具有“左手性”的外尔费米子。但1998年以来发现的中微子振荡（今年的诺贝尔物理学奖）－即具有微小质量－又否定了它的外尔费米子属性，这也使宇宙中是否存在“外尔”基本粒子成为一个科学之迷。 \r\n\r\n  在固体材料中的“宇宙”中，亿万个电子通过相互作用能形成一种决定其母体材料性质的“准粒子”，这些准粒子与基本粒子可能遵循相同的物理规律，例如2004发现的石墨稀就具有无质量狄拉克费米子的“准粒子”。近年来拓扑材料的快速发展为在固体材料中观测外尔费米子提供了新的思路和途径。在这个报告中我将介绍我们是如何在TaAs单晶中发现外尔费米子和它的一些奇特性质和潜在应用。\r\n\r\n个人简介：丁洪，北京凝聚态国家实验室常务副主任和首席科学家。1990年毕业于上海交通大学，1995年获美国伊利诺伊大学芝加哥分校的物理博士。1995年至1998年在美国阿贡国家实验室做博士后。1998年至2008年在美国波士顿学院大学物理系历任助理教授、副教授、正教授。2008年至今为中科院物理所的全职研究员。长期从事凝聚态物理的实验研究，主要利用光电子能谱研究高温超导体和新奇量子材料的电子结构和物理机理，取得了若干个被国际同行广泛认可的重要成果。在学术期刊上发表了160多篇学术论文，被SCI引用超过9000次。1999年获美国的斯隆奖，2008年入选首批国家“千人计划”，2011年被选为美国物理学会会士 。","speaker":{"name":"丁洪 ","affiliation":" 中科院物理所研究员北京凝聚态国家实验室常务副主任和首席科学家"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:30:18Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d780db9ed5db69277a9849","type":0,"title":"The Physics and Roles of AGN Feedback in Galaxies and Galaxy Clusters Bio","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"蒙民伟科技南楼S727"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-05T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-05T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"物理系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"The astonishing phenomena of AGN feedback eject a tremendous amount of energy and possibly momentum into their environs, and are commonly believed to play a key role in cosmic structure evolution.

Is it really responsible for star formation quenching in galaxies? How do AGN feedback events transfer energy to their hosting galaxies and clusters?

By utilizing the electron spin rather than charge, spintronic technologies answer this challenge by offering the opportunity to realize dissipation free data storage and logic devices. Skyrmions have recently been promoted as a low-power, highly scalable spintronic technology. These unique looped spin textures host a range of fascinating phenomena due to their topologically protected quantum state, and offer great potential for low dissipation magnetic information storage. We have recently demonstrated the realization of room temperature artificial Bloch skyrmion lattices over extended areas in their ground state by patterning asymmetric magnetic nanodots with controlled circularity on a PMA underlayer [1]. Another promising route to achieving highly energy-efficient spintronic devices is magneto-ionic control of metal/oxide heterostructures. We have demonstrated effective magneto-ionic manipulation of GdFe/NiCoO interfaces due to a redox-driven oxygen migration, manifested through the interface-sensitive exchange bias effect [2]. We further show that the magnetoelectric coupling moderated by voltage-driven oxygen migration extends beyond the interface region in relatively thick AlOx/GdOx/Co(15 nm) films [3]. These results show promising new approaches towards future spin-based nanoelectronics. This work has been supported by the NSF (DMR-1008791, ECCS-1232275, and DMR-1543582), NRC and DOC. \r\n1. D. A.

Building practical quantum network calls for long coherence time and feasibly scale-up physical systems. In recent 10 years, point defects with individual controllable spins come into the focus due to their scalability, ability of interacting with photons, and long coherence times. One most promising system is the nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. In this talk, we will start by introducing the multi-qubit quantum register composed of an electron spin and several nuclear spins around, the ways to operate them and their coherence properties. By designing photonic structures, we increase the photon collection efficiency which leads to ways of high fidelity spin readout. Emission based and absorption based quantum optical interfaces are realized based on these techniques. We will discuss how to build scalable quantum networks from these two approaches. In the end, progress in other solid state qubit systems like vacancies in SiC, rare earth ion dopant in YAG crystal will be discussed. \r\n个人简介：杨森毕业于清华大学物理系基础科学班，在加州大学圣迭戈分校从事关于半导体量子阱里激子的量子现象的研究，于2009年获得物理博士学位。目前在德国斯图加特大学第三物理研究所从事基于固体点缺陷的量子光学的研究。","speaker":{"name":"杨森","affiliation":" 斯图加特大学"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:30:51Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d780fc9ed5db69277a9855","type":0,"title":"新材料及新性能的大设计探讨","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"理科楼C109"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-28T10:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-28T10:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&低维量子物理国家重点实验室&物理系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"当前，我们正处于充满挑战和竞争时代。如何才能发现更多新材料、新特性,和新器件,这是代表全球科学研究和战略发展的趋势。本报告在总结新材料和新特性的发展前沿的基础上, 提出和讨论一些设计和研究新材料的新观点和正在尝试的新方法，以期获得新型功能材料及新的功能特性，期望对于如何设计新型电子材料，自旋电子材料，多电功能材料，或设计新型电子，自旋，光学等特性，以及对材料基因组等研究有所借鉴。 \r\n本报告也总结我们在高压诱导大幅度增加铁基超导电流及机制，Rashba BiTeCl 体系中的费米面拓扑转变的结果，silicene, 热电，及多铁材料研究的一些重要结果。 并着重讨论自旋零带半导体的新的进展，并将提出它们的一些新的物理概念及其在下一代自旋电子学中的应用。也会共同探讨一下三个材料和性能探索的终极问题。物质、材料及性能越来越复杂，还应该有更多新材料、新物质及新物质粒子、新奇异性能等存在并等待被探索。它们还有多少？它们是什么？如何找到它们？\r\n个人简介：王晓临，澳大利亚Wollongong大学，超导与电子材料研究所教授与副所长，自旋与电子材料研究组组长，澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow，澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者。\r\n山东大学物理本科及固体物理硕士，2000年在澳大利亚Wollongong大学获材料科学博士学位。曾先后在奥地利、日本、美国著名大学研究机构从事研究工作。研究领域广泛，涵盖新型功能材料的设计及其试验和理论研究、涉及超导材料、自旋电子材料、磁性铁电材料、热电材料等。尤其在新材料设计方面，在国际上首次独创提出了自旋零带半导体 (Spin gapless Semiconductors) 新型材料，已在国际上被试验和理论验证。在国际著名杂志上发表论文超过300篇，很多重要工作发表国际顶级杂志，如：Nature Materials, Science Advances, Physical Review Letters, Advanced Materials, Advanced Functional Materials等。论文引用近6000 多次。曾获得英女王伊丽莎白二世学者称号、美国材料学会和国际超导技术中心奖，和 WOLLONGONG大学校长合作奖。近年来以项目带头人身份承担了十多项澳大利亚基金项目，项目经费超过1000万澳元。现为澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow, 澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者。","speaker":{"name":"王晓临","affiliation":" 澳大利亚伍伦贡 (卧龙岗)大学超导与电子材料研究所教授与副所长，澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow，澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:30:52Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d780fe9ed5db69277a9856","type":0,"title":"高速定量磁共振生物标记物成像","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"郑裕彤医学楼D326"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-27T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-27T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"","address":""},"abstract":"报告摘要：\r\n随着国家脑计划的逐步开展和中国医疗逐渐走向精准和个体医疗阶段，对于磁共振成像技术的成像速度和成像的可靠性的要求越来越高。浙江大学脑影像科学技术中心在3T成像仪安装完成的一年中，针对在活体中的结构、功能、生理和病变过程，进行一系列成像技术研究，重点发展高时空分辨、高精度、快速、多模态参数技术，并为生理建模提供中尺度(mesoscale)的定量基础支撑。在这次讲座中我将对我们的一些初步工作作简要介绍，与清华同仁共同讨论。","speaker":{"name":"钟健晖","affiliation":" 教授，浙江大学生物医学工程与仪器学院、浙江大学脑影像科学与技术中心"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:30:54Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d780ff9ed5db69277a9857","type":0,"title":"Photoacoustic imaging and focusing in deep biological tissue","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"精仪系系馆4304大会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-26T03:20:00Z","to":"2016-04-26T03:20:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"精仪系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Abstract\r\nTaking advantage of rich molecular contrasts and safe non-ionizing radiation, optical imaging has been playing increasingly important roles in biomedical applications. However, a fundamental limit of optical imaging in biological tissue is light diffusion, which prohibits high-resolution imaging at depths beyond ~1mm. To break through this limit, Dr. Lidai Wang recently developed photoacoustic imaging and wavefront shaping technologies for in vivo functional imaging, early cancer detection, and focusing light into diffusive regimes. This presentation will first discuss the development of functional photoacoustic imaging modalities which, for the first time, achieved real-time quantitative imaging of oxygen release from single red blood cells in living tissue and enabled measurement of extremely slow blood flow in deep tissue. Then he will present a novel technique named nonlinear photoacoustic guided wavefront shaping (nonlinear-PAWS) that can effectively focus light to its diffraction limit in highly scattering media such as deep biological tissue.\r\nBiography\r\nLidai Wang received the Bachelor and Master degrees from the Tsinghua University, and received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Toronto.

I will discuss two examples to demonstrate the impact of GBs on the chemical and catalytic properties of nanomaterials. In the first example, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was used to probe epitaxial graphene and its interaction with gas molecules. I found that the GBs in graphene on Ru substrate are extremely susceptible to chemical attack by water, which can cut the graphene along GBs, followed by the intercalation of water under the graphene. This process produced a lot of graphene flakes, and I further revealed the superlubric sliding and electronic screening effect of the flakes using STM. In the second, I explored the role of GBs in metal nanoparticles for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. I prepared defect-rich metal nanoparticles using e-beam evaporation and quantified the average GB density by transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic activity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 and CO is directly correlated with GB density in metal nanoparticles. This is the first quantitative study of GB effect in electrocatalysis, and provides a new design principle for nanoparticle electrocatalysts.","speaker":{"name":"冯小峰 （Xiaofeng Feng）","affiliation":" Stanford University"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:30:57Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781029ed5db69277a985a","type":0,"title":"Parallel Sparse Matrix Algorithms for Large-Scale Computer Simulations","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"FIT1-315"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-26T09:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-26T09:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"计算机科学与技术系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Abstract\r\nComputer modeling of physical phenomena plays an increasingly important role in science and engineering.

In particular, for the first time, both superconductivity and magnetism are enhanced with pressure over a broad pressure range.

They are mathematically well described, namely by the Navier-Stokes equations and the respective boundary conditions.While the low Reynolds number regime (i.e., weakly driven systems) has been very well explored in the '80s and '90s of the last century, in the fully turbulent regime major research activity only developed in the last decade. This was also possible thanks to the advancement of computational power and improved algorithms and nowadays numerical simulations of such systems can even be done in the so-called ultimate regime of turbulence, in which even the boundary layers become turbulent. In this talk we review this recen progress in our understanding of fully developed Rayleigh-Bénard and Taylor-Couette turbulence, from the experimental, theoretical, and numerical point of view, focusing on the latter. We will explain the parameter dependences of the global transport properties of the flow and the local flow organisation, including velocity profiles and boundary layers, which are closely connected to the global properties. Next, we will discuss transitions between different (turbulent) flow states.报告人介绍：Detlef Lohse graduated from the University of Bonn in 1989 with a degree in Physics, and completed his PhD at the University of Marburg in 1992.

For a few months, the exploding star is more luminous than one billion suns. Such supernovae are responsible for creating the heavy elements in the universe, including the material of which the Earth is composed. In fact, the iron in our blood and the calcium in our bones were created in a supernova explosion that occurred about 5 billion years ago. During the past 2000 years, about 20 supernovae have been bright enough to see with the naked eye. Chinese astronomers provided the earliest detailed records of supernovae, giving their locations in the sky and the evolution of their brightness. Today, astronomers can pointmodern telescopes toward these ancient supernovae and see expanding shells of hot gas caused by the explosions.\r\nSupernovae manifest some of the most extreme environments in the physical universe, with temperatures ranging from 109 K to &lt; 100 K and densities ranging from 1015 g cm-3 to 10-23 g cm-3. They produce neutron stars and black holes. To probe the conditions in supernovae and their remnants, astronomers use telescopes spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from radio to gamma rays.\r\nWith modern telescopes, astronomers are now discovering hundreds of supernovae each year and learning what kinds of stars explode as supernovae, what factors determine their behavior, and their influence on the evolution of the cosmos. We now understand that supernovae are essential to the origin of life in the universe. Because of supernovae, the universe has found a way to create (at least one) intelligent civilization. We can regard civilizations as devices whereby the universe becomes conscious of itself. \r\n","speaker":{"name":"Richard McCray","affiliation":" 美国科罗拉多大学教授美国科学院院士美国Dannie S.

On the other hand, two-dimensional systems with contact interactions are characterized by continuous scale invariance and support no Efimov physics. This raises questions about the behaviour of three-body recombination in the transition from three to two dimensions. We use ultracold caesium atoms trapped in anisotropic potentials formed by a pair of counter-propagating laser beams to experimentally investigate three-body recombination in quasi-two-dimensional systems with tunable confinement and tunable interactions. In our recent experiments, we observed a smooth transition of the three-body recombination rate coefficient from a three-dimensional to a deeply quasi-two-dimensional system. A comparison between the results obtained near two Feshbach resonances indicates a universal behaviour of three-body recombination in the quasi-two-dimensional regime.

The nature of human forebrain activity related to neural responses in the human thalamic principal sensory nucleus (Vc) to painful, nonpainful thermal and mechanical stimuli are characterized by low threshold calcium spike (LTS) bursts as well as single action potentials. Neurons responding to painful and cold stimuli are more likely to fire with\r\nLTS bursts during the presentation of these stimuli. Thalamic spike trains firing with LTS bursts are more likely than single spikes to activate cortex.Thalamic microstimulation with these burst patterns is more likely to produce the sensation of pain and temperature than other patterns, particularly in chronic pain patients.\r\nThalamic activity will influence pain perception based upon connectivity with the cortical networks, which have been suggested by changes in hemodynamic activity in imaging studies. The connections and connectional weights in these networks were demonstrated by studies of cortical LFPs, which have demonstrated that the pain related networks in the nociceptive pain networks are not fixed but change rapidly with changes in task and time relative to the stimulus. Lesions and chronic pain cause substantial reorganization of these networks. Finally, these results suggest specific therapies for acute and chronic pain based upon new targets for neuromodulation or for specific application of drugs that influence LTS burst firing.\r\nThis work was supported by NIH-NINDS NS38493 and by the Hopkins Neurosurgery Pain Research Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n图片为Dr. Frederick A.

Cold collisions not only give rise to coherent interactions for quantum gas control but also can result in loss processes that limit the time scale for such control. These lectures will cover the basic concepts of cold atomic and molecular collisions, including tunable resonant control. Well-studied experimental systems will be used as case studies to illustrate the concepts and to introduce several topics of current research interest.\r\n\r\nLecture 1: Cold Collision Basics\r\nApril 19 (Tuesday) 2016 10:00 a.m.\r\n\r\nThis lecture describes how to describe cold collisions quantum mechanically, with emphasis on scattering and bound state properties near a collision threshold that are relevant to cold atom studies, emphasizing especially the role of the long range potential between two interacting atoms. The key concept of the scattering length represents a phase shift that gives a unique \"quantum personality\" to the interactions of a pair of cold atoms and determines the properties of a quantum degenerate cold atomic gas. The 7 isotopes of the Yb atom make a good test case of threshold scattering and bound state properties, and help to illustrate the powerful \"quantum defect\" concept.\r\n\r\nLecture 2: Feshbach Resonances I\r\nApril 19 (Tuesday) 2016 2:30 p.m. \r\n\r\nMagnetically tunable scattering resonances known as Feshbach resonances permit the control of the interactions of cold bosonic or fermionic atoms, as demonstrated by a wide variety of applications. This lecture shows how to understand such resonances, for which the dimensionless parameter which characterizes their intrinsic strength ranges over more than 5 order of magnitude among experimentally known resonances . The properties and uses of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances will be illustrated by examples successfully used in experimental work.\r\n\r\nLecture 3: Feshbach Resonances II\r\nApril 21 (Thursday) 2016 10:00 a.m. \r\n\r\nThis lecture continues a discussion of Feshbach resonances, introducing two topics relevant to ongoing research. One is overlapping or interfering resonances, which are important in several practical cases of active research. The other is the case of optically tunable resonances, which serve as an example of a class of resonances that exhibit loss due to spontaneous irreversible decay. This lecture shows how to compare optical Feshbach resonances to magnetic ones, and explains the conditions of laser detuning and intensity under which control of the scattering length can be obtained. Light shifts due to off-resonant optical coupling may also control quantum gases with minimal losses.\r\n\r\nLecture 4: Universality in Atomic and Molecular Collisions\r\nApril 21(Thursday) 2016 2:30 p.m. \r\n\r\nThe concept of \"universality,” that is, having scattering properties that are independent of the details of complex short range chemical interactions, is a powerful one in ultracold physics, since only the scattering length is needed to characterize few-body and many-body physics in this domain. Extending the concept to include also the length scale of the long-range potential greatly enhances our understanding, illustrated by precision binding energy measurements, determination of the effective range, and calculation of few-body dynamics. In the case of highly reactive or inelastic molecular collisions, the concept of long-range universality can be extended to understand the magnitude of collisional losses for a broad class of molecular collisions.\r\n\r\nLecture 5: Other Topics in Cold Collisions\r\nApril 22 (Friday) 2016 10:00 a.m. \r\n\r\nThe lecture series concludes by exploring some additional topics that are relevant to current research areas. These include chaotic dynamics with complex atoms or molecules, which have dense sets of overlapping resonances but may also have some universal properties. The effect of reduced dimension, or tight quantum confinement, on cold collisions will be examined for some aspects of atomic and molecular collisions.\r\n\r\n个人介绍: Paul S. Julienne obtained his Ph.

My talk will focus on the physical consequences of the dark photon and how to search for it with current experiments. \r\n个人简介：2014-now, John A McCone Postdoctoral Fellow at Caltech\r\n2011-2014, Postdoctoral fellow at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics\r\n2006-2011, PhD student at University of Maryland\r\n2002-2006, undergraduate student at Peking University.","speaker":{"name":"安海鹏","affiliation":" Caltech"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:31:44Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781319ed5db69277a9882","type":0,"title":"关于宇宙的大问题","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"清华大学大礼堂"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"物理系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"清华大学“新世界，新视野”天文公众讲座系列之十一\r\nTitle:  关于宇宙的大问题\r\n  Some Big Questions about the Universe\r\nSpeaker: Brian P.

It offers a valuable balance between electrochemical activity, chemical stability, and thermomechanical compatibility with the widely used electrolyte, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Despite its widespread implementation, questions regarding the reaction pathway for oxygen electroreduction on this material remain open. Here, a fundamental study of the reduction mechanism is carried using thin film methods. Libraries of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3+δ (LSM) thin film microelectrodes with systematically varied thickness or growth temperature were prepared by pulsed laser deposition, and a novel robotic instrument was used to characterize these libraries in automated fashion by impedance spectroscopy. All impedance trends are consistent with a reaction pathway involving oxygen reduction over the LSM surface followed by diffusion through the film and into the electrolyte substrate. The surface activity is found to be correlated with the number of exposed grain boundary sites, which decreases with either increasing film thickness (at constant growth temperature) or increasing film growth temperature (at constant thickness). These findings suggest that exposed grain boundaries in LSM films are more active than exposed grains towards the rate-limiting surface process, and that oxygen ion diffusion through polycrystalline LSM films is faster than several prior studies have concluded.报告人介绍：Brief BiographySossina M. Haile is the Walter P. Murphy Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University, a position she assumed in 2015 after serving 18 years on the faculty at the California Institute of Technology.

To realize an areal density of higher than 2 Tbit/in2 in the future, both media and readers need technical breakthroughs. Since the bit size will be in the range of 20 nm, the magnetic grains in the recording media must be reduced to less than 6 nm, requiring the use of ferromagnetic materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy such as L10 FePt. The shield-to-shield spacing of read sensors must also be smaller than 20 nm with low device resistance (resistance-area product RA~0.1 &#61527;&#61549;m2), which is very difficult to achieve using MgO based tunneling magnetoresistance devices. In this talk, we will address the materials challenges to the realization of an ideal media nanostructure using L10 FePt for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) media and narrow readers for &gt; 2 Tbit/in2 areal density. Recently significant progress has been made in current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistive (CPP-GMR) devices using highly spin-polarized Heusler alloy ferromagnetic layers and new spacer materials. The very high magnetoresistance ratios achieved in CPP-GMR are encouraging for future read head applications of CPP-GMR, or its laterally extended version, lateral spin valves. The devices with high magnetoresistive output at low RA may open new applications in addition to disk read heads.\r\nBio:Kazuhiro Hono received the BS and MS degrees in Materials Science from Tohoku University in 1982 and 1984, respectively, and a Ph.D. degree in Metals Science and Engineering from Penn State in 1988.

Understanding the twinning mechanisms in TWIP steels is essential for the successful application of TWIP steels in automotive industry. The first part of this work is to employ sub-micon and micron-sized single crystalline pillars to investigate the nucleation and growth mechanism of deformation twins. It is found that the nucleation and growth of deformation twins are due to emission and glide of successive partial dislocations. The twin thickness can range from nanometres to micrometres. A physical model is proposed to simulate the nucleation and growth of deformation twins and the model predictions agree well with experimental observations. The second part of this work investigates the deformation mechanism of bulk samples in TWIP steels. Deformation mechanism at high strain rates were investigated. By synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments, the present work demonstrates that a higher strain rate leads to a lower dislocation density and a lower twinning probability, which is opposite to other fcc metals. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in our latest works that the contribution of twins to the flow stress is limited.Instead, dislocations, via forest hardening, account for up to ~90% of the flow stress increment after yielding in the present TWIP steel. In other words, the contribution of twins to the work-hardening rate and flow stress of TWIP steels may have been overestimated in the literature.\r\nShort Bio:Dr. Huang received his BEng and MPhil in Mechanics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and his PhD in Materials Science in 2008 from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), The Netherlands.

But humans are, also uniquely, creators of art and seekers of meaning; in this sense we rely on the humanities to structure and critique our understanding of ourselves. It is current to frame the challenges we face as a species as essentially technological undertakings, to be solved thru technological developments and thru the development of policy based in the social sciences. And yet, ironically, it is also current to frame the challenges we face as individuals as spiritual challenges, or challenges of meaning. Yet it cannot be that the challenges of the collective are in fact independent of our personal and individual challenges. This talk will explore, from the context of an engineer, the multiple and essential roles of the humanities in addressing our challenges and shaping our future.\r\n人类被定义为制造工具者，是用工具制造工具的唯一物种；唯有人类依靠工程技术人员创造生存必需的产品和工具；但也唯有人类创造艺术，追寻意义。我们依靠人文学来构建和批评人的自我认识。我们作为一个物种在面对挑战时，往往依靠技术活动或以社会科学为基础的政策发展手段来解决问题。具有讽刺意味的是，我们作为个体所面对的挑战，却往往是来自精神层面或意义层面的挑战。群体所面对的挑战无法摆脱个体所面临的挑战而存在。本演讲从一位工程师的角度出发，探讨在应对挑战与塑造未来的过程中，人文学所扮演的多元和不可或缺的角色。\r\n\r\n （本次演讲为文化素质教育讲座专场）","speaker":{"name":"James P.

The lighter elements like lithium and carbon, are windows into stellar evolution. The heavier alpha elements, like magnesium and calcium, trace galactic evolution.

Unlike conventional crystalline semiconductors, solution-processed materials are compatible with low-cost, large-area roll-to-roll processing, needing lower energy intensity for device fabrication; at the same time, solvent engineering of the materials enables tunability over their electronic and optical properties. In this talk, I will discuss the design and characterizations of optoelectronic and bioelectronic devices based on solution-processed semiconductors. Using photodetectors and solar cells as examples, I will talk about the unique structure-property correlations in solution-processed semiconductors and how these correlations can be utilized to achieve tunable device performances. I will describe the applications of our devices in energy, environmental, and biomedical sciences. \r\nBiography:Ni Zhao received her Ph.D degree in Physics from the University of Cambridge (UK) in 2008.

Current research projects in the group include the application of macrocyclic host-guest chemistry using cucurbit[n]urils in the development of novel microcapsules, supramolecular hydrogels, drug-delivery systems based on dynamic hydrogels, adhesion between a variety of surfaces, the conservation and restoration of important historical artefacts1a through the exploitation of supramolecular polymer chemistry and sensing and catalysis using self-assembled nanophotonic systems. \r\n Modification of solution viscosity using multivalent polymers has been accomplished through dynamic cross-linking in water using CB[8]. These hydrogels, with extremely high water content (up to 99.75% water by weight), have also been prepared by utilising renewable cellulose derivatives. Their rapid formation1b and shear-induced flow properties make these materials perfectly suited for use as injectable hydrogels for delivery of therapeutics. \r\n Polymer-inorganic composite materials can be readily prepared based on the CB[8] coupling of multivalent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to functional copolymers. When these systems are attached onto gold surfaces intricate control is achieved over the site-selective immobilisation of colloids and peptides. This has great scope for the development of optical materials, chemical sensors2 and biological separations. Additionally, we have developed an innovative new technique for manufacturing 'smart' microcapsules in large quantities using continuous flow in a single step from tiny droplets of water.3a The major advantage of this manufacturing platform over current methods is that a variety of cargos can be efficiently loaded during the microcapsule formation at room temperature, and the dynamic supramolecular interactions provide control over the porosity of the capsules and the timed release of their contents using stimuli.3b Our CB[n] based host-guest systems exhibit dynamic self assembly and are capable of responding to stimuli (photochemical, chemical, and thermal) allowing for external control and function to be built into the materials. \r\n\r\nReferences \r\n1.

The first two lectures will give an introduction and survey of these two topics and their interrelationships, while the third and fourth will discuss more recent developments: an application of modular forms to counting the number of coverings of a torus by a surface of genus g (\"mirror symmetry in dimension one\"), a wonderful generalization of this result by Bloch and Okounkov, with a new and very simple proof, and recent joint work with Dawei Chen and Martin Moeller that generalizes and applies this theorem to questions concerning moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces.\r\n\r\nAll of the lectures will be aimed at non-experts, and are intended to be accessible to enthusiastic senior undergraduate students as well as to graduate students or researchers from other fields. At least the first talk should be understandable even for first or second year undergraduates.\r\n\r\nTALK 1: 16:30-17:30, 2016-4-6\r\n\r\nIn how many ways can you divide a set of 4 apples into smaller subsets?\r\n\r\nWe assume that the apples are identical, so only the size of the subsets counts. Then the answer is \"5 ways\", with the sizes of the subsets being (1,1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,3), (2,2), or (4). We say that 4 has 5 partitions, or p(4)=5. Partitions, first studied by Euler, are a basic object of combinatorics, and have many wonderful properties. In this lecture I will describe some of these, e.g.: how the number p(200) = 3972999029388 could be computed by hand, long before there were electronic calculators; how the study of partitions led Euler to the wonderful idea of \"generating functions\"; the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic formula for the size of p(n) when n is large; and the famous Ramanujan congruences like the divisibility of p(11n+6) by 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALK 2: 16:30-17:30, 2016-4-8\r\n\r\n\r\nModular forms have been studied for about 150 years and are among the basic tools of modern number theory. They have a dual nature: one the one hand they are functions of a complex variable with a very large non-commutative symmetry group, and on the other hand they can be seen as power series whose coefficients include many interesting arithmetical functions like partitions, sums of powers of divisors, or number of representations of integers as sums of squares. Because of this they have many applications in all parts of number theory, e.g., they played the key role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I will give the main concepts and lots of examples, and discuss how modular forms can be used to prove some of the properties of partitions discussed in the first lecture.\r\n\r\nTALKS 3 and 4: 16:30-17:30, 2016-4-11/13\r\n\r\nIn \"mirror symmetry\", which plays a central role in string theory as well as in several parts of modern algebraic geometry, one is interested in particular in counting the number of maps of a Riemann surface of given genus g to an n-dimensional complex manifold of a special type called Calabi-Yau varieties. For n=1 this leads to the question of counting the ramified covers of a torus (= surface of genus one = one-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold) by a surface of genus g. The answer turns out to be given by a (nearly) modular form, as discovered by Dijkgraaf and other string theorists and proved by Kaneko and myself. I will describe this theorem and then a huge generalization of it found by Bloch and Okounkov, together with a new and very simple proof of that theorem. Finally, I will describe recent joint work with Moeller and Chen that uses this connection with modular forms to solve various problems in the moduli space of surfaces, including a proof of the Eskin-Zorich conjecture on the large genus asymptotics of Masur-Veech volumes and the calculation of the so-called \"Siegel-Veech constants\" in the theory of flat surfaces.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Speaker:\r\n\r\nDon Bernard Zagier is an American mathematician whose main area of work is number theory. He is currently one of the directors of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany. He has been a professor at the Collège de France in Paris, France from 2006 to 2014. Since October 2014, he is also a Distinguished Staff Associate at ICTP. \r\n\r\nZagier studied for three years at MIT, completing his bachelor's and master's degrees and then receiving his PhD at Oxford University. He received his Habilitation at University of Bonn. In 1976, aged only 24, he became Germany's youngest professor. \r\n\r\nZagier collaborated with Hirzebruch in work on Hilbert modular surfaces. Hirzebruch and Zagier coauthored Intersection numbers of curves on Hilbert modular surfaces and modular forms of Nebentypus, where they proved that intersection numbers of algebraic cycles on a Hilbert modular surface occur as Fourier coefficients of a modular form. \r\n\r\nOne of Zagier’s results is a joint work with Benedict Gross (the so-called Gross–Zagier formula). This formula relates the first derivative of the complex L-series of an elliptic curve evaluated at 1 to the height of a certain Heegner point. This theorem has some applications including implying cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture along with being an ingredient to Dorian Goldfeld's solution of the class number problem. As a part of their work, Gross and Zagier found a formula for norms of differences of singular moduli. Zagier later found a formula for traces of singular moduli as Fourier coefficients of a weight 3/2 modular form.\r\n\r\nZagier collaborated with John Harer to calculate the orbifold Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of algebraic curves, relating them to special values of the Riemann zeta function.\r\n\r\nZagier found a formula for the value of the Dedekind zeta function of an arbitrary number field at s = 2 in terms of the dilogarithm function, by studying arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds. He later formulated a general conjecture giving formulas for special values of Dedekind zeta functions in terms of polylogarithm functions. He discovered a short and elementary proof of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares.\r\n\r\nZagier won the Cole Prize in Number Theory in 1987, the von Staudt Prize in 2001 and the Gauss Lectureship of the German Mathematical Society in 2007. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997.\r\n\r\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Zagier\r\n\r\n","speaker":{"name":"Don Zagier","affiliation":" 德国马克斯&amp;#8226;普朗克数学研究所的主任荷兰皇家艺术学院的外籍院士"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:32:40Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781699ed5db69277a98a6","type":0,"title":"费孝通学术纪念讲座：实用的虔诚：都城的仪式与德行之研究","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"清华大学熊知行楼社会学系211会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T03:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T03:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学社会学系","school":"","address":""},"speaker":{"name":"麦克尔·赫兹菲尔德（Michael Herzfeld）","affiliation":" 哈佛大学人类学系教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:32:41Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d7816b9ed5db69277a98a7","type":0,"title":"Watching and Controlling Single Molecules in nm-scale Plasmonic Cavities","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"理科楼C302"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T03:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T03:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&物理系&低维量子物理国家重点实验室","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Coupling betweenplasmonicnano-components generates strongly red-shifted resonances combined with intense local field amplification on the nanoscale.

This large disparity in the number of photonic and electronic devices on the same chip arises because of the limitation in how small conventional silicon photonic devices can be made. In this talk we shall describe our recent work in two different approaches to enable the integration of smaller photonic devices. One approach for smaller photonic devices is to exploit the guiding of light at metal-dielectric interfaces from surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) modes. Plasmonic devices not only offer the advantage of smaller size, but in the case of optical modulators they can also provide higher energy efficiency and high speed operation. One important challenge for plasmonic devices on silicon chips is how to couple light efficiently into the plasmonic device. We shall present some of the different designs of nanophotonic couplers to couple light efficiently from a conventional silicon waveguide to a plasmonic slot waveguide. Another approach to make smaller photonic devices is to exploit the photonic bandgap of nanophotonic structures for highly compact resonators, filters or polarizers. Unlike convention photonic crystals which require high precision in the periodicity of the photonic lattice, photonic bandgaps from hyperuniform disordered structures are more tolerant to fabrication errors. We shall describe a waveguide polarizer with over 30 dB extinction ratio over a 98 nm optical bandwidth that occupies a short length of 8 μm (including the waveguide tapers) based on a hyperuniform disordered photonic bandgap structure.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker: \r\nHon Ki Tsang received the B.A. (Hons) degree in 1987 in Engineering (Electrical and Information Sciences), and the Ph.D. and M.A. degrees in 1991, all from the University of Cambridge.

Optomechanical systems have shown their unique advantages in fundamental research as well as practical applications in high-precision metrology, signal processing, and data communication. Optomechanical devices exhibit many variations with their sizes and mechanical masses spanning orders of magnitude. Going to the other end of the spectrum, I will talk about our experimental research of integrated nanoscale optomechanical and optoelectromechanical devices with pico/femtogram masses and gigahertz vibrational frequencies. These integrated devices hold great promise for many burgeoning areas in science and engineering, such as single-molecule detection, laser cooling, and quantum information processing. \r\n\r\nAbout the speaker: \r\nXiankai Sun received his Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics from California Institute of Technology, USA, in 2010.

However, another type of gravitational waves produced during inflation echo in the very beginning of the Universe has yet been detected. The most sensitive approach searching this primordial gravitational waves is by observing the polarization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Several dedicated CMB experiments have been operating or under construction at the South Pole Station and the Atacama desert in Chile, in particular the BICEP series of experiment have been the most sensitive and successful experiment for this purpose. We have proposed to build the first Chinese CMB experiment at the Ali Observatory in Tibet. The goal is to open up the northern sky not accessible to any other site to search for primordial gravitational waves. I will talk about the current status of this project. \r\n\r\nBio: Dr. Meng Su is currently a joint Pappalardo/Einstein Fellow at the Department of Physics and Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), since 2012.Hereceived hisBachelordegree in Physics from Peking University in 2007, andearned his Ph.D. in Astrophysics from Harvard University in 2012. Dr.Su is interested broadly in cosmology and high energy astrophysics.He workedwith Prof. Matias Zaldarriaga on various topics in cosmology,andwith Prof. John Kovac on BICEP, an experiment at the South Pole searching for signatures of primordial gravitational waves on the Cosmic Microwave Background, and finallywith Prof. Douglas Finkbeinerand Tracy Slatyer, Dr. Su has discovered a giant gamma-ray bubble structure in the Milky Way (named, \"Fermi Bubble\"), which has been selected as one of the top ten physics-related news in 2011 by the American Physical Society. Dr. Su was awarded the 2014 Rossi Prize (along withFinkbeinerand Slatyer) fortheir discovery of the Fermi Bubble, by the AAS High EnergyAstrophysics Division.","speaker":{"name":"苏萌","affiliation":" MIT"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:33:08Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781859ed5db69277a98b7","type":0,"title":"工程物理系第157期“工物学术论坛”：从宫颈癌治疗看放射治疗的技术发展","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"工物系刘卿楼104会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-31T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-31T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"工物系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"报告摘要：宫颈癌是常见的妇科恶性肿瘤，放疗是宫颈癌的主要治疗方法。近百年的宫颈癌放疗历史体现了放射治疗的技术进步和发展。近距离腔内放疗是宫颈癌不可缺少的根治性治疗技术，从点剂量为基础的二维治疗技术正在向以图像引导的自适应三维治疗技术发展。\r\n报告人简介：张福泉，1986年毕业于白求恩医科大学，现任北京协和医院放疗科主任。中华医学会放射肿瘤治疗学分会常委，北京医学会放射肿瘤分会副主委，北京医师协会放疗专委会副会长，北京市放射治疗质控中心主任。中华肿瘤杂志编委，中华放射肿瘤杂志编委等。承担国家自然科学基金和北京市首发基金科研项目。擅长肿瘤放射治疗，尤其是常见肿瘤和疑难病症的放射治疗，妇科肿瘤放疗，近距离放射治疗。\r\n\r\n\r\n第157期“论坛”主请人联系方式：\r\n王 石 62796203 wangshi@tsinghua.edu.cn","speaker":{"name":"张福泉","affiliation":" 主任医师 教授 博士生导师   北京协和医院放射治疗科"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:33:09Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781879ed5db69277a98b8","type":0,"title":"专利技术成果转移与技术评估","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"华业大厦1103"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-31T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-31T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学成果与知识产权管理办公室","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"各院系、各位老师：\r\n为进一步促进学校专利技术成果转化，特邀请专家举行 “专利技术成果转移与技术评估”讲座。\r\n请各院系感兴趣的老师和学生积极参加，如参加请回复邮件至：yuanhong@tsinghua.edu.cn\r\n","speaker":{"name":"林耕","affiliation":" 科技部火炬中心技术市场发展咨询专家、北京技术市场管理办公室原主任、高级工程师"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:33:11Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781889ed5db69277a98b9","type":0,"title":"汽车系第169期学术沙龙-汽车产业新常态","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"清华大学汽研所三层301会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-31T12:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-31T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"","address":""},"abstract":" 董扬，1956年出生，研究员级高级工程师，1984年毕业于清华大学汽车工程专业，获工学硕士学位。曾任国家机械工业局行业管理司副司长，北京汽车工业控股有限责任公司总经理；现任中国汽车工业协会常务副会长、世界汽车组织（OICA）副主席，中国汽车工程学会副理事长、中国机械工业联合会副会长、国家科学技术奖励评审专家。\r\n 董扬同志熟悉汽车技术、行业政策。在中汽总公司、机械部工作期间一直从事汽车行业的科技管理和行业管理工作。他曾主持制定了全国汽车行业“八五”、“九五”科技规划；执笔《汽车行业中、长期科技发展纲要》，载入国家科技“白皮书”；主持过车用汽油机电子控制系统研究、电动汽车研究，车身开发研究等多项国家科技攻关项目，参与组建联合电子公司，并参加了中国加入WTO的中美、中欧谈判。在北京汽车工业（集团）总公司工作期间，成功地确立了北京汽车与韩国现代、与戴－克集团的合作伙伴关系，为北京汽车工业的长远发展奠定了基础。\r\n 自2007年9月担任中国汽车工业协会常务副会长兼秘书长以来，董扬带领新一届协会秘书处提出了建设“中国一流世界知名行业协会”的奋斗目标，在加强汽车行业与政府的沟通、反映企业行业诉求、为汽车行业争取更好的发展环境等方面正在进行着不懈的努力。\r\n\r\n","speaker":{"name":"董扬"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:33:12Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d7818a9ed5db69277a98ba","type":0,"title":"清华环境学术沙龙第276期:A novel shortcut nitrogen removal process using an algal-bacterial consortium in a photo-sequencing batch reactor","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"环境学院321会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-31T10:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-31T10:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"院学术委员会主办","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"环境学术沙龙第276期\r\n\r\n报告题目：A novel shortcut nitrogen removal process using an algal-bacterial consortium in a photo-sequencing batch reactor \r\n报告人：Sarina J.

In the global era, universities are assuming a critical and more prominent role in the advancement of knowledge in service to the world. Going forward, it is international collaboration between and among universities – and across disciplines in the arts, sciences, and humanities – that will drive innovation, engagement and solutions/approaches to complex global challenges like climate change, population health and sustainable development.\r\n\r\n演讲嘉宾：克里斯蒂娜·派克森（Christina Paxson）\r\nChristina Paxson is the nineteenth president of Brown University and Professor of Economics and Public Policy.\r\n\r\nAs president, she has worked with students, faculty and staff to develop Building on Distinction, a strategic plan for Brown that will inform the University’s next decade of growth and progress. The plan seeks to build on the progress of the last decade and provides a vision and set of broad goals to achieve higher levels of distinction as a university that unites innovative education and outstanding research to benefit the community, the nation and the world. It calls for targeted investments to attract and support the most talented and diverse faculty, students, and staff; capitalize on existing strengths; and provide the environment to foster rigorous inquiry and discovery across the disciplines. The plan highlights the need to keep a Brown education affordable for talented students from all economic backgrounds and to sustain a community with the diversity of thought and experience required for excellence.\r\n\r\nPrior to her appointment as President in July 2012, she was dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University.\r\n\r\nA 1982 honors graduate of Swarthmore College, Phi Beta Kappa, Paxson earned her graduate degrees in economics at Columbia University (M.A., 1985; Ph.D., 1987). She began her academic career at Princeton University in 1986, becoming assistant professor of economics and public affairs the next year. She became a full professor in 1997 and was named the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Economics and Public Affairs in 2007. While at Princeton, Paxson also served as associate chair (2005-2008) and chair (2008-2009) of the Department of Economics and was the founding director of a National Institute on Aging Center for the Economics and Demography of Aging. In 2000, she founded the Center for Health and Wellbeing, an interdisciplinary research center in the Woodrow Wilson School. The center established multidisciplinary graduate and undergraduate certificate programs in health and health policy. She served as the center’s director until 2009.\r\n\r\nInitially working on international economic problems of labor supply, mobility, savings, inequality, and aging, Paxson focused increasingly on the relationship of economic factors to health and welfare over the life course, particularly on the health and welfare of children. She has been the principal investigator on a number of research projects supported by the National Institutes of Health, including a study of adversity and resilience after Hurricane Katrina. She has authored or co-authored numerous journal articles, was elected vice president of the American Economic Association in 2012, and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. In January 2016, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston named Paxson to its board of directors.\r\n\r\n特别提醒：\r\n1、因场地所能容纳观众人数有限，请感兴趣的同学及时进行预报名。如报名人数已满，系统将提前关闭。\r\n2、如果您想及时获知清华海外名师讲堂的最新信息，请关注清华大学信息门户“教务公告”及“学术活动”栏目。\r\n\r\n联系电话：62797498\r\n国际合作与交流处\r\n研究生院\r\n教务处\r\n\r\n\r\n附：清华海外名师讲堂简介\r\n“清华海外名师讲堂”是汇集我校高端国际交流资源，面向广大同学开办的高层次、前沿性、成系列的海外人士演讲，设有“全球领导力”和“前沿科技”两大系列。演讲人汇集诺贝尔奖得主、著名学者、外国政要、知名大学校长、跨国企业高管等名家名人。为广大同学提供了拓展国际视野和学术视野，提升外语水平和交流能力的宝贵资源。\r\n“清华海外名师讲堂”面向全校学生开放，一般每年开设20-30讲，课程采用学生IC卡记录考勤，无需选课。凡在读期间累计听讲8次并递交总结报告者，可获得1个学分（相关事宜请联系62797498）。","speaker":{"name":"克里斯蒂娜&#8226;派克森（Christina Paxson）","affiliation":" 美国布朗大学校长"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:33:23Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781959ed5db69277a98c1","type":0,"title":"Quantum Many-Body Localization in Atomic Systems","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"理科楼三楼报告厅（C302）"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-28T03:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-28T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&物理系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Ultracold atomic systems have witnessed rapid developments in the last decade in many aspects, and has now reached a new era where quantum correlations and many-body complexity emerge in unprecedented controllable fashion. These developments stimulate unique angles to study quantum many-body physics especially in non-equilibrium aspects. Specifically, I will discuss quantum many-body localization, a dynamical quantum phase transition at infinite temperature, in optical lattices. I will describe thermalization in an isolated quantum system in the sense of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and its breakdown in the presence of strong disorder. I will present our work on nonergodic metallic phase that arises from coexisting localized and delocalized degrees of freedom in one dimensional incommensurate lattices. The conceptual novelty of this nonergodic metallic phase lies in that it is extended in real space but \"localized\" in the high-dimensional many-body Hilbert space. Numerical evidence and theoretical arguments for this novel phase will be presented.  \r\n个人简介：\r\nDr. Xiaopeng Li received his Bachelor's degree from University of Science of Technology of China in 2008, and his Ph.D. degree from University of Pittsburgh in 2013.

A number of numerical tests are carried out to validate the method, and the results demonstrate that the DUGKS can serve as an efficient numerical method for multiscale transport problems.\r\n报告人简介：郭照立，华中科技大学煤燃烧国家重点实验室教授，国家杰出青年基金获得者，长江学者特聘教授。2000年于华中科技大学获得工学博士学位，2000-2003年在华中科技大学煤燃烧国家重点实验室从事博士后研究，2003-2005年香港科技大学机械系访问学者，2005年至今在华中科技大学工作。主要从事复杂流动的介观物理模型和数值方法、微纳尺度及跨尺度流动与传热、多相多组分渗流微观机理等方面的基础研究。承担国家自然科学基金4项、973专题2项。发表SCI论文120余篇，SCI引用3000余次，SCI-H指数25；合著专著3部；获得国家自然科学二等奖1项。","speaker":{"name":"郭照立","affiliation":" 教授，华中科技大学煤燃烧国家重点实验室"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:33:26Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781989ed5db69277a98c3","type":0,"title":"直接建模的计算流体力学方法和在多尺度输运过程中的应用","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"航天学院蒙民伟科技大楼北楼N414会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-28T09:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-28T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学航天航空学院","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"流体力学方程是对流体动力学在不同尺度上的直接描述，其中包括在连续介质尺度上的Navier-Stokes方程和分子自由程尺度上的Boltzmann方程。但在这两个尺度之间，由于非平衡流建模的复杂性，现在还没有可靠和有效的描述。理论上讲随着对观察流体尺度的变化，流体力学应该有一个连续谱的方程。虽然在历史上有很多理论方面的尝试，但并没有给出过一个清晰的随尺度变化构建方程的有效途径。传统的计算流体力学方法主要是给出偏微分方程的数值解。追求的目标是在网格大小趋于零的条件下给出方程的精确解。对于多尺度问题，如果没有这样一个连续变化的多尺度方程，计算流体力学也就变得无能为力，多数研究变成怎么把有限个分立的方程的解连接起来。如果我们摒弃计算流体力学是偏微分方程数值解的概念，把构建方程和计算结合起来，可以发展出适合多尺度、多物理流动的新方法。既然流体力学方程是在特定尺度上对流体的描述，为什么不能在网格尺度上建模、并且直接描述流体演化呢？所以直接在离散空间建模，同时构造计算流体力学格式是解决多尺度流体问题的有效途径。与直接离散偏微分方程的传统做法相比，基于离散空间直接建模构造出的数值方法考虑了网格尺度和物理模型之间的匹配，能做到不同尺度上物理过程的连续过渡，从而实现对多尺度流动的高效模拟。Boltzmann方程的跨尺度的演化解为直接建模提供了重要的支撑。本讲座将讨论直接构建计算流体力学方法的理论基础、建立统一的气体动理学格式、以及这类方法在气体动力学，辐射转移，和等离子体模拟中的成功运用。\r\n\r\n\r\n报告人简介：徐昆1987年本科毕业于北京大学，地球物理系，天体物理专业 。同年通过中美联合招收物理研究生考试(CUSPEA)，到美国纽约哥仑比亚大学天文系攻读博士学位。1993年9月取得博士学位。然后在美国普林斯顿大学机械与航空系 做博士后研究。1996年9月任职于香港科技大学数学系，助理教授（1996-2001），副教授（2001-2004），教授（2004-2013），数学系及机械航空系的讲座教授（2013-至今）。同时为北京大学工学院长江讲座教授（2008-至今）。研究领域：计算流体力学数值方法，非平衡稀薄流模拟，计算稀薄和连续流的统一算法，NS方程的高阶计算格式。","speaker":{"name":"徐昆","affiliation":" 教授，香港科技大学数学系和机械航空系"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:33:28Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d7819a9ed5db69277a98c4","type":0,"title":"工程物理系第155期“工物学术论坛”：Two Pre-existing Models for the 750 GeV Diphoton Resonance 报告摘要： 报告人简介：","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"刘卿楼219会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-25T04:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-25T04:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"工物系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"报告摘要：I discuss two models which I proposed, one in 1986 and the other in 2002, both of which contain new physics that can explain the 750 GeV diphoton resonance, recently observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Due to numerous challenging research problems and a wide range of applications, SA has been an active research area in many CS fields. In recent years, its research has spread from CS to social, management, and health sciences. Its applications have spread from traditional businesses, organizations, and individuals applications to conversational agents such as chatbots and intelligent personal assistants. There are now hundreds of companies in the SA space. In the first part of the tutorial, I will introduce SA and discuss the current state-of-the-art SA techniques. In the second part, I will introduce lifelong machine learning (LML), which follows naturally from the discussion of SA as LML is particularly suitable for solving SA and NLP problems. LML is different from the classic machine learning (ML) paradigm in that classic ML simply runs a learning algorithm on a given data, which we call isolated learning, while LML aims to learn as humans do. It retains and cumulates the knowledge learned in the past and uses it to help future learning and problem solving.\r\n\r\n讲演者简介\r\n\r\nBing Liu is a professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).

A class of intermediate-mass black holes has also been found. These \"seeds\" help us understand the formation and growth of supermassive black holes and the origin of quasars in the early Universe.

Autonomous driving could mitigate some of the driver errors and deliver great potential for road safety as well as for road capacity. There are various degrees of autonomous driving. Among highly autonomous driving scenarios, the driver’s task would switch from a controller role to a monitoring mode. This leads to concerns over the driver being left out of the loop. How would drivers react they need to take over the vehicle control? This seminar offers some insight into this issue, based on experimental work carried out in the University of Leeds Driving Simulator.\r\n\r\n报告人简介：\r\nDr Frank Lai is a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds.

We consider a financially constrained retailer who sources from multiple suppliers, each of whom can increase its sales by providing trade credit. By offering trade credit, any given supplier relaxes the retailer’s financial constraint, which automatically benefits the other suppliers. This externality of providing trade credit is particularly detrimental when the free-riding suppliers sell substitutable products. Our model helps to explain, among other, why suppliers of differentiated products extend more trade credit than suppliers of standardized goods. In addition, our model predicts and empirically validates a negative relation between a firm's reliance on trade credit and the number of its suppliers.","speaker":{"name":"Dr. Jiri Chod, Boston College","affiliation":" Associate Professor at the Carroll School of Management, Boston College"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:34:09Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d781ca9ed5db69277a98d6","type":0,"title":"Magnetic wafer based magnonics","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"理科楼三楼报告厅（C302）"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-23T10:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-23T10:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&物理系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Magnonics, which involves unified information storage and processing using magnons—spin waves that are collective quasi-particle excitations of magnetic moments—offers a promising platform for next-generation, energy-saving information technology. Many magnonic structures have been proposed and studied in a range of designs, but a unified and scalable magnonic platform is still lacking.Here, we propose the design of magnonic integrated circuits that can in principle perform a large number of magnonic operations. [1] We use domain walls and surface anisotropy stripes as two different spin wave waveguides. The magnonic integrated circuits that we design include a single square magnetic wafer, which is analogous to a silicon wafer. We experiment with yttrium iron garnet thin film magnetic wafers of several sizes (roughly a few thousand nanometers on a side). Since the magnetic texture of our circuits can be easily modified, our magnonic hardware architecture is reprogrammable, unlike most present-day information-processing architectures. Using this new architecture, we design the simplest magnonic component, a spin wave diode that admits only the unidirectional propagation of spin waves. We find that the bound spin wave states in a domain wall become chiral and are spatially separated depending on their propagation direction, which enables us to realize the diode effect for spin wave transport. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the function of the spin wave diode is easily altered from forward-transmitting to reverse-transmitting by simply moving domain walls via current-induced spin-transfer torque. Our magnonic architecture opens up new pathways for realizing a pure spin wave computer.Reference:[1]. Lan, J., Yu, W., Wu, R. &amp; Xiao, J. Spin-Wave Diode. Phys. Rev.

By permanent noncoalescence and nonwetting we distinguish cases in which the phenomena may be observed for unlimited time from transient examples such as two drops of liquid bouncing off one another or a liquid droplet bouncing off a solid wall. To achieve permanent noncoalescence or nonwetting, a mechanism is needed for establishing a lubricating film of surrounding fluid (usually air) and sustaining this film as the liquid/liquid or solid/liquid surfaces are moved toward each other.\r\n\r\nOne technique for achieving these lubricating films is the use of thermocapillarity, the variation of a liquid’s surface tension with temperature. We have demonstrated that nonwetting may be achieved through non-contact, optical heating and that this may be further employed to levitate droplets above solid surfaces and to translate them along these surfaces. The implications of this technique for lab-on-a-chip applications will be discussed, along with items of more fundamental scientific interest.\r\n\r\nG.

Moreover, the continuous sample concentration and separation are not possible in the conventional IEF. To overcome these challenges, free flow isoelectric focusing (FFIEF) can be used in which a flow field is applied in the direction perpendicular to the applied electric field. However, efficient design of microfluidic chip is cumbersome for FFIEF process as one has to take care of both flow and electric field in addition to pH field. In this talk, we will present a new mathematical modelto study the roles of flow and electric fields for efficient design of microfluidic chip for continuous separation of proteins from an initial well mixed solution. Results obtained from our model will be compared with experimental data to demonstrate the efficacy of the model. Finally, a new channel design will be presented to increase the separation resolution by introducing cross-stream flow velocity. Our results indicate that the separation resolution can be improved by three folds in this new design compare to the conventional straight channel design used in traditional experiments.\r\n\r\nBiography:Prof. Prashanta Dutta received his MS and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of South Carolina and Texas A&amp;M University, respectively.

By modeling the interaction of wind energy’s intermittence and system operation, we reveal the incompatibility between the new technologies, old system operations, and climate-change policies. Our results suggest the incompatibility will weaken wind energy’s ability to reduce Greenhouse Gases and threat the efficiency of a carbon tax. We suggest that market regulators must reexamine the current market design and policy settings based on system-perspective-based data analysis. For example, we develop a criteria system to help market operators use wind-energy and market data to select an appropriate dispatch protocol. The criteria system is deduced by modeling the system dynamics of adopting different dispatch protocols to integrate wind energy into a power grid. An empirical study, which is calibrated according to the data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, confirms the effectiveness of the criteria system for dispatch protocol selection. By using the criteria system to adjusting the dispatch protocol, wind energy’s capability to reduce CO2 is improved by 30% in the ERCOT market. We also demonstrate that the stochastic dispatch must replace the static dispatch, which is currently used in most electricity markets, once a carbon tax is implemented. Actually, if a $6/ton carbon tax is implemented in the Texas market operated according to the stochastic protocol, the CO2 emission is similar to the emission level from the same market with a $16/ton carbon tax operated according to the static protocol. Correspondingly, the $16/ton carbon tax associated with the static protocol costs 42.6% more than the $6/ton carbon tax associated with the stochastic protocol.\r\nBio：Yang Yu is a Ph.D. Candidate in Stanford University.

Its revolutionary potential is now universally recognized. Data complexity, heterogeneity, scale, and timeliness make data analysis a clear bottleneck in many applications, due to the complexity of the patterns and lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms.\r\nAdvanced machine learning and data mining algorithms have been developed to address one or more challenges listed above. It is typical that the complexity of potential patterns may grow exponentially with respect to the data complexity, and so is the size of the pattern space. To avoid an exhaustive search through the pattern space, machine learning and data mining algorithms usually employ a greedy approach to search for a local optimum in the solution space, or use a branch-and-bound approach to seek optimal solutions, and consequently, are often implemented as iterative or recursive procedures. To improve efficiency, these algorithms often exploit the dependencies between potential patterns to maximize in-memory computation and/or leverage special hardware (such as GPU and FPGA) for acceleration.\r\nBiography: Wei Wang is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles and the director of the Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi).

The discontinuity at the interface is universal in all applications like PN junction, catalysts, biomaterials, etc. Understanding interactions at the interface will bring us towards new materials and new applications. My presentation will show three major examples in my previous research. \r\nThe first part was using nanoparticles to achieve special thermoelectric materials, called phonon glass electron crystal materials. The name of these materials come from their low thermal conductivity and high electric conductivity, which give them outstanding thermoelectric performance. However, the high cost and special skills were required. In my work, interfaces of nanoparticles actually scattered phonon but still can form network after spark plasma sintering, therefore, significantly lowered the cost of preparing such materials. \r\nThe second part was anti-virus materials, including visible like powered materials and external-condition-free materials. The key advantage was optimizing surfaces of the materials to increase interaction chance between viron and materials. \r\nThe third part was about stem cell and ultrastructure of hydrogels. The current research of hydrogel have not made any conclusion for the ultrastructure of them, which was a very basic problem in tissue engineering. My work unveiled the structure of gelatin based hydrogel and analyzed its pore distribution that was an important step for understanding stem cell migration problems. \r\nBy investigating interfaces and optimizing interactions, I believe we can design new functional materials and find new applications for current available materials. \r\n\r\nBiography:Ding Weng received his M.Sc. from Tsinghua University before moving to the University of California, Los Angeles, United States, where he obtained his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Yunfeng Lu in 2012.

Advancing perovskite solar cell technologies toward higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) requires delicate control over the perovskite film and the relevant interfaces, and deep understanding of defects. The properties of the perovskite can be manipulated (or optimized) during film growth by careful control of the intercalation reaction between the organic and inorganic species. We developed two approach for perovskite film growth: 1) vapor assisted solution process, and 2) one-step solution process with enhanced film reconstruction under controlled humidity. The underlying film growth mechanism, defect property and the corresponding device performance have been carefully examined. We further control the carrier dynamics throughout the entire device, based on careful choices of the carrier transport materials, and the modification of electrodes. These efforts lead to suppressed carrier recombination in the absorber, efficient carrier injection into the carrier transport layers, and good carrier extraction at the electrodes. The fabrication of our perovskite solar cells was conducted in air and from solution at low temperatures, which should simplify future manufacturing of high performance, low-cost, and large-area perovskite solar cells. \r\n\r\nBiography:Dr. Qi Chen holds both his B.S and M.S degrees in Tsinghua University.

They have been extensively used for genetic transfection, virotherapy, vaccines, drug delivery, imaging agents, and materials science. Despite these successes, bottom-up anti-virus biomolecular engineering still presents three substantial challenges: membrane protein, complex assembly, and bioconjugation. Here we adopt a cell-free synthetic biology strategy to address those three challenges. Cell-free synthetic biology is emerging as a powerful interdisciplinary bioengineering approach aimed to harness and expand the capabilities of natural biological systems without using intact cells. It enables proper folding of viral membrane protein, expression of proteins toxic to cells, fast high-throughput screening, controllable virus particle assembly, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins for bioorthogonal conjugation. We use cell-free synthetic biology to design and produce universal influenza vaccine and genome-free virus-like particle for human health applications. The resulting trimeric influenza hemagglutinin stem domain could be used as a potentially broadly protective influenza vaccine. The virus-like particle is extensively modified to improve its functional properties for better vaccine design, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nYuan Lu received his B.S.

Since expanding the infrastructures is complex, slow and costly, the key to relieving the tense between the rapidly increasing customer demands and slowly ramping-up infrastructures is to highly utilize the existing resources and strongly protect application performance simultaneously.\r\nIn this talk, I will present two projects which help cloud providers to find a good balance between efficiency and robustness in their infrastructures. First, in network traffic management, we propose the concept of “Forward Fault Correction (FFC)” which proactively prevents a network from congestion caused by faults like configuration, link and device failures. FFC requires a traffic engineering (TE) to guarantee no congestion without reconfiguring the network as long as the number of faults is under k. The challenges to realize FFC lie in the overhead in network throughput and the computational complexity to prepare for a huge number of fault cases. We develop an efficient and uniform method to obtain a TE with FFC under diverse kinds of faults.\r\nNext, I will present the design of the next generation of Microsoft’s online service delivery infrastructure, called Footprint. Footprint jointly coordinates all key routing and resource allocation decisions, to achieve high efficiency and low risk. It decides how to map users to frontend proxies, proxies to backend datacenters, and traffic to network paths, and configures all infrastructure components involved in service delivery, including network switches, proxies, load balancers, and DNS servers to achieve this mapping. We show that fully realizing the potential of the joint control on infrastructure requires faithful modeling of system dynamics. A major issue is that after we change system configuration, its impact is not immediate but manifests only gradually. To capture temporal variations, we model system load and performance as a function of time. Solving time-based models can be intractable (e.g., time is continuous), but we show how all load and performance constraints can be met by considering a small number of time points.\r\n\r\nShort Bio：\r\nHongqiang (Harry) Liu is a Postdoctoral Researcher in Microsoft Research, Redmond Lab.

Although light and heat are routinely used as conventional energy inputs to drive chemical reactions, harnessing mechanical energy for the same goal is not trivial. In the 1930s, Staudinger found that polymers are able to undergo mechanically driven chemical bond scission, and, today, we are on the verge of understanding and exploiting this process at an unprecedented level. In the beginning of the talk, the experimental basis for this interesting energy transformation process will be presented. Then, I’ll describe our recent studies on addressing mechanochemistry in polymer solutions through intramolecular crosslinks, and finally, I’ll present new mechanochemical approaches to self-healing applications.\r\nResearch InterestsCharles Diesendruck is interested in the action of mechanical force at the molecular level.

One technique we use is called helium spin echo spectroscopy, the setup is essentially a time resolved atom interferometer, which is capable of measuring atomic scale motion which takes place on a time scale of pico to nanoseconds[1], a range which is inaccessible using conventional surface science techniques. I will explain the basic principles of the technique and the experimental apparatus, and present as an example a recent study where we used this apparatus to study the fast and highly correlated diffusive motion of sodium atoms on a nano-structured surface[2]. Using molecular dynamics simulations for the interpretation of the data, we extract the energy barrier for diffusion, a lower limit for the Schwoebel barrier and also observe a non-isotropic repulsive interaction between the Na atoms which is attributed to a screening effect of the atomic step[2]. A second different research project, I will briefly describe, is an attempt to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study surface structure and dynamics. NMR is a particularly sensitive technique which is often used to determine atomic-scale structure and dynamics in the bulk, however, it is hardly used in surface science due to its low detection sensitivity. We have demonstrated that a high purity ortho-H2O beam can be obtained using simple magnetic manipulations[3-4]. I will describe our ongoing attempts to use this molecular beam to grow thin ice films which are ~ 100% spin polarised and perform the first NMR experiments from a deposited monolayer of hyper-polarized water molecules.\r\n[1] Science. 304, 1790 (2004)[2] Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters., 2015, 6, 4165 (2015).[3] Science, 331, 319 (2011) [4] Physical Review A, 86, 062710 (2012)","speaker":{"name":"Prof. Gil Alexandrowicz ","affiliation":" Department of ChemistryTechnion-Israel Institute of TechnologyTechnion City, Haifa 32 000Israelhttp://schulich.technion.ac.il/Gil_Alexandrowicz.htmhttp://sudy.net.technion.ac.il/"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:35:23Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d7820c9ed5db69277a9905","type":0,"title":"New Perspectives of Designer Oligosaccharides: From Fixing Human Faulty Genes to Controlled Gene Expression and anti-Leishmaniasis Agents Research Interests","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"化学老馆301会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-08T09:45:00Z","to":"2016-03-08T09:45:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Research InterestsDevelopment of new antibiotics and compounds to treat genetic rare diseases.The primary research objective in our lab is in the area of carbohydrate synthesis, chemical and enzymatic, to solve key biological problems by understanding bio-catalysis at the molecular level.

The crucial parameter for ferromagnet(F)|normal metal(N) interfaces is the spin mixing conductance that governs the absorption of a transverse spin current and the spin transfer torque. However, the spin-mixing conductance is a purely nonrelativistic concept, while there is mounting evidence that spin-orbit interactions at interfaces generate additional spin-flips and spin-orbit torques. We have solved this issue by introducing an “effective” spin mixing conductance for weakly relativistic materials. First ab initio results on ferrite|metal interface indeed indicate an enhancement that can be very significant for selected crystal orientations. \r\n\r\nMassive particles, i.e. the electrons, as well as quasi particles, i.e. magnons, can carry a thermal spin current that generates torques at the interfaces.

We review how these ideas have led to better understanding of many aspects of QCD, including the structure function of proton, shower evolution of jet, and kinematics of the Higgs boson.","speaker":{"name":"朱华星","affiliation":" Center for Theoretical Physics, Masachusetts Institute of Technology"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:35:39Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d7821c9ed5db69277a9913","type":0,"title":"Emerging Trends in the Microelectronics & Semiconductor Industry","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"微电子所B311会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-02-29T10:00:00Z","to":"2016-02-29T10:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学微电子所","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Abstract:\r\nAs IC technology approaches scaling limits; to gain competitive advantage, prosper and grow, the various segments of the semiconductor industry have begun evolving.

It has been known that 1D Peierls chains are 1D topological insulators and solitons are their edge states protected topologically. Each indium atomic wire on Si(111) is composed of double Peierls chains, which yield uniquely four, not two, degenerate ground states. This fourfold degeneracy corresponds to the first materials realization of a Z4 topological insulator as revealed its band structure [3]. In turn, this unique topology brings about three distinct soliton edge states within the band gap as clearly observed in scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy [4]. These solitons are endowed with chirality, which corresponds to the chiral edge current of higher dimensional topological insulators [4]. We thus for the first time clarify the 1D chiral edge state of a 1D topological insulator. The exciting prospect of utilizing chiral solitons for the topologically-protected multi-level informatics, which I would call ‘chiral solitonics,’ is introduced. \r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

Mobile terminals (MTs), equipped with multi-homing capabilities, can explore network cooperation to simultaneously aggregate the offered resources from different networks to support the same application and thus increase the data rate. On the other hand, as the gap between the MT energy demand and battery capacity continues to increase, the MT operational time in between battery charging has become a significant factor in service quality. In this presentation, we introduce an energy management system for MTs to support a sustainable multi-homing video transmission, over the call duration, in a heterogeneous wireless access medium. Through statistical video quality guarantee, the MT can determine a target video quality lower bound for a target call duration. The target video quality lower bound captures the MT available energy at the beginning of the call, the time varying bandwidth availability and channel conditions at different radio interfaces, the target call duration, and the video packet characteristics in terms of distortion impact, delay deadlines, and video packet encoding statistics. The MT then adapts its energy consumption to support at least the target video quality lower bound during the call. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over two benchmarks, and some performance trade-offs.\r\n讲演者简介\r\nWeihua Zhuang has been with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada, since 1993, where she is a Professor and a Tier I Canada Research Chair in Wireless Communication Networks.

Second, I will present exact results for certain transport properties of the topological surface states at a strongly interacting quantum critical point for a continuous transition between a Dirac semimetal and a superconductor.","speaker":{"name":"Joseph Maciejko","affiliation":" University of Alberta"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:36:17Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d782429ed5db69277a9931","type":0,"title":"石墨烯基材料声子热传导的尺度、维度、应力和温度效应","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"清华大学液晶大楼3层301会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-01-06T10:00:00Z","to":"2016-01-06T10:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学微纳米力学与多学科交叉创新研究中心(CNMM)","school":"","address":""},"abstract":" 石墨烯基材料由于优异的室温热导率，在工程热管理和复合材料热传导增强方面具有极高的应用价值。因此，表征其热传导特性和理解相应机制具有重要意义。\r\n 基于第一性原理晶格动力学，我们系统研究了单层石墨烯、多层石墨烯和体相石墨系统中的声子热传导行为，重点包括： 1）尺度效应；2) 温度效应；3）应力效应；5）应力与尺度耦合效应；6）随着层数的增加，当从二维度单层石墨烯过渡到三维体相石墨，热传导行为的维度效应。基于此研究，我们得到如下主要结论：1）对于单层石墨烯、三层石墨烯和石墨，计算热导率与当前实验测试值吻合的相当好，表明计算方法的准确性。2）单层石墨烯面外声学声子自由程达到～8 cm（对应于本征热导率，300 K），是其热导率具有强尺度效应的根源。随着层数的增加到无限层（即石墨），热导率尺度效应逐渐降低到～8 μm；3）对于这些石墨烯基系统，在无和有张应力条件下，面外声学声子主宰热传导；4）在三声子理论框架下，张应力导致单层石墨烯热导率随着尺度增加而发散；而对于多层石墨烯和石墨，他们的热导率在张应力作用下依然收敛；并且，随着应力增加，他们热导率存在峰值。背后原因在于应力依赖的热容和声子寿命间的竞争。5）对张应力作用下的单层石墨烯，增加温度加强了三声子散射，但其热导率仍然发散。应力与尺度耦合效应导致：仅在500 μm的尺寸以上时，大的应力导致更大的热导率。对于小的尺寸，这个耦合效应也导致峰值热导率。\r\n 此系统研究增进了我们对二维热传导问题的理解；对于如何采用尺度和应力来调控石墨烯基材料的热导率也提供了洞见。\r\n\r\nBio：匡友弟，博士，2007年毕业于华中科技大学力学系，取得工程力学博士学位。从2008～至今，分别在香港城市大学建筑系、香港理工大学机械系和香港科技大学航空航天与机械系从事博士后研究。研究兴趣包括智能材料与结构、纳米力学和物理力学。代表性研究工作发表在Nano Letters、Nanoscale、Nanotechnology、Composite Science and Technology、Polymer、Carbon、Microfluidic and Nanofluidic、Smart Materials and Structures等国际学术杂志上。","speaker":{"name":"匡友弟","affiliation":" 博士, 香港理工大学"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:36:18Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d782449ed5db69277a9932","type":0,"title":"Nanostructured Polymer-Ceramic Composites for Electrical Energy Storage","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"高压馆205"},"time":{"from":"2016-01-05T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-01-05T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学电机系","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"演讲题目：Nanostructured Polymer-Ceramic Composites for Electrical Energy Storage\r\n演讲人：美国宾州州立大学材料系 王庆教授\r\n时间：2016年1月5日下午 2:00-3:00\r\n地点：高压馆205\r\n联 系 人：何金良教授","speaker":{"name":"王庆","affiliation":" 美国宾州州立大学材料系 教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-13T04:36:20Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57d782459ed5db69277a9933","type":0,"title":"材料院《材料科学论坛》：Link the structures, growth and properties of two dimensional materials by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"BeiJing","address":"清华大学材料院学术报告厅（逸夫技术科学楼1-205）"},"time":{"from":"2016-01-05T10:00:00Z","to":"2016-01-05T10:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"材料院《材料科学论坛》联系人：于荣 老师 62773998","school":"","address":""},"abstract":"Abstract: Fabrication, structure and property are the three keypoints for materials science.

Using a sample of 365 nearly face-on star-forming galaxies observed by MaNGA, we demonstrate how DIG in star-forming galaxies impacts the measurements of emission line ratios, hence the interpretation of diagnostic diagrams and gas-phase metallicity measurements. We show that Hαemission line surface brightness (SB) is a reasonably good proxy to separate regions dominated by Hiiregions from those dominated by DIG. At fixed metallicity, DIG displays enhanced [SII]/Hα, [NII]/Hα, [OII]/Hβ, and [OI]/Hαfor almost all galaxies in our sample. In line ratio diagnostic diagrams, contamination by DIG moves Hiiregions towards composite or LI(N)ER-like regions. Photoionization models for Hiiregions with varying metallicities and ionization parameters fail to predict the line ratios seen in DIG without any additional variables. Ionizing spectrum hardness is the most likely the needed variable. Leaky Hiiregion models are capable of explaining the DIG with lower [OIII]/Hβthan Hiiregions, but the DIG with higher [OIII]/Hβthan Hiiregions needs another ionization source. Our result favors ionization by evolved stars as a major ionization source for higher [OIII]/HβDIG. \r\nDIG can significantly bias the measurement of gas metallicity and metallicity gra- dient derived using strong line methods. Metallicities derived using N2O2 is optimal because it exhibits the smallest bias and error. Using O3N2 and N2S2Hαto derive metallicities can bias the metallicity gradient as large as±0.05 dexRe&#8722;1for an in- dividual galaxy, a significant bias compared with the universal metallicity gradient of -0.1 dexRe&#8722;1for local star-forming galaxies. UsingR23and N2=[Nii]/Hαto derive metallicities will systematically bias the metallicity gradients by&#8764;-0.1 dexRe&#8722;1and&#8764;0.05-0.1 dexRe&#8722;1.\r\nBio: Dr. Kai Zhang obtained his B.S.and Ph.D from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC, 2003.9-2012.6).

Many of these discrepancies are due to idealized models that were needed in the past because the alternative – massive computing – was not feasible. Important examples to consider are fundamental puzzles in our understanding of earthquake physics, the nature of distributed brittle faulting in the earth crust, deformation at plate boundaries below and away from the seismogenic zones, the mechanics of the opening and closing of backarc basins, and the complex physics and chemistry of reactive fluids, pressure solution and diagenesis in porous rocks under stress. In this talk (andin the discussions that will follow) I would like to review some of these problems and propose approaches to solve them. Specifically, I will show that a key aspect to obtain solutions in the future must involve replacing the reliance on idealized models with the use of massive computing to rigorously (and fearlessly) simulate the real complex behavior of the relevant rock and earth systems – including their nonlinear, heterogeneous, and the couplings between deformation, fluid flow and mass transfer under stress. A second key aspect will be the future role of visualization of complex earth processes. Here we need to move from the most common current use of cartoons to animation and than to simulation and ultimately to process prediction.\r\nProf. Amos Nur was the founder and director of the Rock Physics and Borehole Geophysics in Stanford University since 1977.

It is gifted with outstanding electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. It’s very responsive to its environment, since interactions of any material with the environment proceed through the surface and 2D materials are nothing but a surface. This may be a blessing for sensing, but can also be a curse as it frequently degrades the electrical properties. Attempts to alleviate the detrimental impact of environment have been the key impetus for the development of 2D material stacks in which graphene is encapsulated between boron nitride layers. It drastically reduces the influence of the environment and it is possible to enhance graphene’s electrical conduction properties significantly. This straightforward example can however be generalized to generate more complex so-called van der Waals heterostructures with more elaborate sequences of 2D materials. This presentation will motivate the need for van der Waals stacking to bring out the best of 2D materials and will give a flavor of how powerful van der Waals stacking can be to create designer heterostructures with engineered properties. It will address just a few of the simplest examples, both covering applied and basic sciences, but they will bring the point home that van der Waals stacking is a truly powerful paradigm. \r\n个人简介：\r\nJurgen Smet is heading the independent research group Solid State Nanophysics at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research.

An ultrahigh efficient chopper ( called HEECS, efficiency over 99%, around 20kw ) was proposed with several circuit topologies. The proposed effect was verified at a motor-test bench, which can simulate the practical EV, and the proposed power train was experimentally compared between with and without the chopper. The second very high efficient system is the wireless energy transmission for electric trains aiming the elimination of the pantograph. A coaxial type transformer with air gap is proposed and after optimization of the structural and electrical parameters, a very high efficiency (over 96%) was realized with a few hundred power [W] range.

They have some attractive features such as lower voltage stress of each semiconductor power device, lower output harmonics, and lower EMI compared with the general 2-level converters. These features contribute to improve the control performance in some applications. In this study, it is verified that the multi-level converter is useful to realize extremely high-performance control in a motion control system. For the next step, the multi-level converter is also expected to enhance the performance of high-speed power flow control in the micro grid applications.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\nHidemine Obara received the Bachelor, Master, and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Chiba University, Japan, in 2010, 2012, and 2015, respectively.

To study the deformation behaviors of different steel materials under non-homogeneous bending, in the present study, several kinds of bent steel plates: 1) a ferrite single-phase steel, 2) an austenite single-phase steel, 3) a hot-rolled duplex stainless steel, and 4) a metastable austenitic steel for stress-induced martensite transformation, were characterized by TOF Bragg-edge transmission imaging. Pulsed neutron transmission imaging experiments were performed at BL10 NOBORU and BL22 RADEN of the MLF/J-PARC. using a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) two-dimensional (2D) detector. The measured Bragg-edge spectra were analyzed by RITS (Rietveld Imaging of Transmission Spectra) code. Quantitative 2D mappings of crystallographic texture, crystallite size and phase distribution were successfully provided by non-destructive transmission technique. The obtained BET imaging results were also compared with those using the neutron diffraction experiment method and optical microstructure observations. The microstructure evolution caused by bending deformation in all samples, especially non-homogeneous martensite transformation in austenitic steel, will be presented. In addition, some other examples of BET imaging for engineering application will be introduced.","speaker":{"name":"苏玉华","affiliation":" Japan Atomic Energy Agency","position":"博士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:10:10Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92339ed5dbfb329933d2","type":0,"title":"Design and Applications of Digital Polymers","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学老馆301会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-09-09T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-09-09T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学系许华平课题组","school":"清华大学","address":""},"speaker":{"name":"Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Lutz","affiliation":" Precision Macromolecular Chemistry, Institut Charles Sadron 23 rue du Loess, 67034 Strasbourg, France.

The quest for truly universal definitions of units has led to the gradual adoption of fixed values of fundamental constants; the value of the speed of light was fixed in 1983 to define the metre. In 2018, a further revolution will take place with new definitions of the kelvin, kilogram, ampere and mole in terms of fixed values of the Boltzmann constant k, Planck constant h, fundamental charge e and Avogadro’s number NA. The seminar will chart the evolution of some of the base units, the advantages and shortcomings of their definitions and show how the present system will change in the near future.

Estimating the Economic Losses of Hurricane in a Coastal City: A Case Study of Houston in Hurricane IKE 滨海城市受飓风影响的经济评估：以飓风艾克对休斯顿产生的影响为例\r\n2005年的飓风卡特里娜和飓风瑞塔使得墨西哥湾沿岸地区遭受了巨大的经济损失。尽管2008年的飓风艾克没有那般严重，但海湾地区依然遭受重创。而在受灾地区中，美国的第四大城市、第六大都市圈休斯顿损失尤为惨重。本次报告从美国国家飓风中心获取了飓风艾克的风暴参数，并运用美国联邦应急管理局的HAZUS模型来评估风力强度和普查地段的财产损失。本次报告采用的系统分析方法结合了灾害模型、区域产出—投入模型和空间分配模型。该分析法能估算出飓风艾克对休斯敦地区造成的财产及业务中断损失的空间分布情况。在飓风艾克过境以后，运用该模型估算出的财产损失结果应与该地区的保险损害索赔申请情况大体一致。该模型通过对经济损失空间分布情况的估算，能帮助政府决策者识别成本效益最优的减灾方式，并对救灾的人力物力资源进行更加合理有效的分配。\r\n\r\n【英文概要】Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 caused tremendous economic losses in the Gulf Coast region. Though Hurricane IKE in 2008 was relatively less severe, it still caused significant damage in the Gulf Coast Region, especially in Houston, the fourth largest city and the sixth largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. This study obtains the storm parameters of Hurricane IKE from the National Hurricane Center and then employs the hurricane model in FEMA’s HAZUS to estimate the strength of wind and the property damages by census tract. To fill the gaps in HAZUS and other disaster loss estimation models, this study adopted a systematic method that combines disaster models, a regional input-output model, and a spatial allocation model to estimate the spatial distribution of property damage and business interruption losses of Hurricane IKE in the Greater Houston region. The modeling results of property damage are reasonably close to the estimates from insured damage claims after Hurricane IKE. The spatial distribution of economic losses in industrial sectors generated by the model is needed for policy makers and planners to identify the most cost-effective options for disaster mitigation and allocate manpower and resources for disaster relief efficiently and equitably.","speaker":{"name":"潘起胜","affiliation":" 德克萨斯南方大学城市规划与环境政策学系教授、系主任 国际中国规划学会前主席 武汉大学城市设计学院客座教授","position":"教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:10:20Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de923d9ed5dbfb329933d8","type":0,"title":"Electric Field Assisted Chemical Vapour Deposition of Thermochromic Thin Films","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学工程系工物馆313会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-09-07T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-09-07T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学工程系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"651487784574506718.jpg","speaker":{"name":"Russell Binions","affiliation":" School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London","position":"教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:10:21Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de923f9ed5dbfb329933d9","type":0,"title":"Parallel Reactivity Between Metal-Metal δ Bonds and Carbon-Carbon π Bonds","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学老馆 301 会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-09-07T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-09-07T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学系席婵娟课题组","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"Research Interests:Inorganic synthesis and their applications in organic synthesis\r\nSelected Honors &amp; Awards:&#61656; 台湾科技部博士后著作奖&#61656; 台湾斐陶斐荣誉学会荣誉会员\r\nRecent publications:1.

The primary task of a reactor physicist is to predict detailed neutron behavior in a reactor during both normal operation and abnormal events. Nowadays, these missions are mainly completed via numerical modeling and simulation techniques, relying heavily on computer equipment and computational methodologies. Compared to other research areas such as thermal hydraulics and materials science, reactor physics remains as a fundamental, yet intangible, and relatively matured realm in the nuclear engineering discipline; years of accumulated understanding in physics and advancements in mathematics have achieved enormous success in solving many reactor physics problems. However, any remaining unsolved problems are generally onerous and unamiable.This talk will encompass the history and prospective future of R&amp;D endeavors in reactor physics, with a particular emphasis on the role of computational reactor physicists in the new nuclear energy era. The speaker will expand the topic with a connection to his own career development as a reactor physics practitioner, and include narratives of three interesting reactor design projects he has worked or been working on. The talk will be wrapped up with a summary of challenging and contingent research topics in computational reactor physics.\r\n报告人简介：Dr. Zeyun Wu (吴泽云) is currently Research Associate in the Department of Material Sciences and Engineering at the University of Maryland (UMD).

But, energy and mass are two very different physical concepts; how can they be exchanged with each other? We think the key to answer this question is to realize that particles are waves in nature. Thus, particle properties like energy and momentum are related to their corresponding wave properties (frequency and wave vector). Mass is clearly a particle property, can it also be related to a wave property? Such possibility is investigated in this work. We found that mass and energy indeed share similar physical nature in the wave perspective. Both of them are related to the curvature of bending the vacuum medium during the propagation of the excitation wave.

However, only comparatively recently, due to the advent ofexperiments in cold atomic systems with long coherence times, has ourdetailed understanding of its connection to quantum statisticalmechanics seen remarkable progress.\r\nExtending these ideas and concepts to the non-equilibrium setting is achallenging topic, in itself of perennial interest. Here, we studyperhaps the simplest non-equilibrium class of quantum problems, namelyFloquet systems, i.e. systems whose Hamiltonians depend on timeperiodically, $H(t + T) = H(t)$. For these, there is no energyconservation, and hence not even a natural concept of temperature.\r\nWe find that it is nonetheless possible to identify severalfundamentally distinct thermodynamic ensembles. We also ask if thereexists a sharp notion of a phase in such driven, interacting quantumsystems. Disorder turns out to play a crucial role, enabling theexistence of states which are straightforward analogues of equilibriumstates with broken symmetries and topological order, whileothers--genuinely new to the Floquet problem--are characterized by acombination of order and non-trivial periodic dynamics.\r\nThis work was done in collaboration with Arnab Das, Vedika Khemani,Achilleas Lazarides and Shivaji Sondhi.\r\nReferences: Phys.

An understanding of spin dynamics in inhomogeneously magnetized systems is indispensable for further development of nanoscale magnetic memories. This lecture provides a transparent picture of inhomogeneously magnetized systems, such as magnetic nanowires with domain walls and disks with magnetic vortices, and presents not only technological developments and key achievements but also the unsolved puzzles and challenges that stimulate researchers in the field.\r\nFirstly, the basic concept of an inhomogeneously magnetized system is described by introducing a magnetic vortex structure in a magnetic disk. A magnetic domain wall in a magnetic nanowire is also provided as a typical example. The magnetic field-driven dynamics of these inhomogeneously magnetized systems are described to illustrate the uniqueness of this system.\r\nSecondly, the electric-current-induced dynamics of magnetic vortices and domain walls are described. One can flip the core magnetization in a magnetic vortex using electrical current excitation, and move a domain wall by current injection into a wire. The next part focuses on the applications of the current-induced-magnetization dynamics in devices. The basic operations of two kinds of magnetic memories—magnetic vortex core memory and magnetic domain wall memory—are demonstrated.\r\nThe lecture describes not only the current understanding about inhomogeneously magnetized systems, but also the unexpected features that have emerged. It concludes with prospects on future developments, in which more surprises will certainly be found.\r\n个人简介：\r\nTeruo Ono received the B.S., M.S., and D.Sc. from Kyoto University in 1991, 1993, and 1996, respectively.\r\nAfter a one year stay as a postdoctoral associate at Kyoto University, he moved to Keio University where he became an assistant professor.

A one-dimensional semiconducting nanowire with strong spin-orbit interaction that is proximity coupled to a standard s-wave superconductor is a particularly attractive implementation of a topological superconductor due to its relative ease of fabrication. One of the prime signatures of the existence of Majorana fermions in such a structure would be the observation of the 4pi Josephson effect. Furthermore, several proposed braiding schemes heavily rely on good quality Josephson junctions working at considerable magnetic field strengths. I will present the typical behavior we found of the supercurrent in such nanowires, along with our current insights in the physical interpretation of our observations.\r\nIn the second half of my presentation, I want to shift focus to my new post-doctoral research topic:\r\nThe emergence of chaos in a single spin in silicon\r\nClassical conservative systems usually exhibit rapid dispersion of initial conditions – chaos – while the quantum version of the same systems exhibit quasi-periodicity, localization and tunneling through classically forbidden regions of phase space. How to reconcile this strikingly different behavior has been the topic of much theoretical debate, but little experimental proof, and none whatsoever on a single quantum system observed in real time. My project aims at achieving the first real-time experimental observation of the quantum dynamics of a single classically chaotic system – a periodically-driven non-linear top. This I want to achieve by combining the existing infrastructure for donor based spin qubit in silicon in the group of Prof. Morello at the University of New South Wales with a new type of donor, having a large nuclear spin and a non-linearity due to nuclear quadrupole interaction.

In these cases turbulence arises despite the linear stability of the laminar flow and transition is caused by finite amplitude perturbations. Despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies it has not been possible to determine a well-defined critical point nor to clarify the nature of the transition. It will be shown for the examples of pipe and Couette flow that the onset of sustained turbulence is a nonequilibrium phase transition. The critical point is determined by resolving the extremely long time scales of the underlying growth and decay processes. By detailed numerical simulations and experimental measurements close to the transition point we determine the critical exponents and show that this transition falls into the directed percolation universality class.\r\nAbout the speaker: Prof. Bj&ouml;rn Hof obtained his Ph.D in 2001 from University of Manchester, UK. He then successively took the positions as a Research Associate in Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands and a Lecturer in University of Manchester, UK, and a Research Group Leader at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, Germany. In 2013, he accepted the offer as a Professor in IST Austria and stayed there since.\r\nProf. Hof and his research group investigate how complex chaotic dynamics develop in nonlinear systems, of which fluid turbulence is probably the most common and at the same time most relevant example. Their approach is to investigate turbulence when it first arises from laminar motion. By combining detailed laboratory experiments with highly resolved computer simulations and apply methods from nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, they were able to decipher key aspects of the transition scenario and identify universal features shared with out-of-equilibrium systems in many other areas of physics. Their hope is that their approach could eventually lead to a more fundamental understanding of the nature of turbulence, going beyond a purely statistical view.\r\nProf. Hof has made important contributions to the understanding of the transition from laminar flow to turbulence, which is reflected in publications in several high-impact journals, including 3 in Science, 2 in Nature, 1 in Nature Physics, 1 in PNAS, and 7 in Physical Review Letters.","speaker":{"name":"Bj&ouml;rn Hof","affiliation":" Institute of Science and Technology Austria, Klosterneuburg, Austria"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:10:54Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de925f9ed5dbfb329933ea","type":0,"title":"Challenges and solutions for memristors used for memory and neuromorphic computing","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学微电子所（新所311）"},"time":{"from":"2016-08-26T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-08-26T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":" \r\nNumerous perspective applications have been proposed for memristive devices. However, each application emphasizes on different merits of device properties and imposes different challenges on device performance. A practical solution to those challenges is to add an auxiliary device to each of the memristor. For memory applications, this device is often called “selector”, mainly employed to enable large memristor crossbar arrays by mitigating the so- called “sneak path current” issue with its nonlinear current-voltage characteristic. We have obtained over 1E10 nonlinearity by using engineered materials for such devices. In neuromorphic computing the accumulation and extrusion of Ca2+ in the pre- and postsynaptic compartments play a critical role in initiating plastic changes in biological synapses. To emulate this fundamental synaptic dynamic process in electronic devices, we developed diffusive Ag-in-oxide memristors with a temporal response during and after stimulation similar to that of the synaptic Ca2+ dynamics. The diffusive memristor and its dynamics enable a direct emulation of both short- and long-term plasticity of biological synapses and provide a viable solution for the crucial synaptic dynamics in neuromorphic computing. \r\nBriefbio: \r\nDr. Yang is a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Conventionally, disk evolution is thought to be viscously driven, as a result of turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). However, the weakly ionized nature of PPDs introduces non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) effects that substantially modify the coupling between gas and magnetic fields in complex ways. I first show that these effects lead to suppression or damping of the MRI in most regions of PPDs, and instead, global disk evolution is driven primarily by a magnetized disk wind. Next, I describe a semi-analytical model to characterize the wind properties, and show that they are determined by the amount of external magnetic flux threading the disks, as well as disk thermal structure. For typical PPDs, wind mass loss rate is likely comparable to accretion rate, and mass loss is most significant in the outer disk (&gt;10 AU). This will substantially enhance the dust-to-gas mass ratio in PPDs and promote planet formation. Finally, I describe the first global simulations of PPDs that aim to incorporate the most realistic disk microphysics, and fully accommodate disk wind in the computational domain. In the near future, these simulations will allow us to explore global disk structure and long-term evolution from first principles, and to reassess the theory of planet formation based on the new paradigm of PPD gas dynamics.\r\n\r\nBio: Dr. Xuening Bai obtained his B.S. in mathematics and physics from Tsinghua University in 2007, and his PhD in astrophysics from Princeton University in 2012.

Therefore, rationally tailoring adsorption energy of intermediates on TMOs to achieve desirable catalytic performance still remains a great challenge. Here we show the identification of a general and tunable surface structure, coordinatively unsaturated metal cation (MCUS), as a good surface reactivity descriptor for TMOs in OER. Surface reactivity of a given TMO increases monotonically with the density of MCUS, and thus the increase in MCUS improves the catalytic activity for weak-binding TMOs but impairs that for strong-binding ones. The electronic origin of the surface reactivity can be well explained by a new model proposed in this work, wherein the energy of the highest-occupied d-states relative to the Fermi level determines the intermediates’ bonding strength by affecting the filling of the antibonding states. Our model for the first time well describes the reactivity trends among TMOs, and would initiate viable design principles for, but not limited to, OER catalysts.\r\nBiographyBin Liu received his B.Eng.

For example, topologically protected quantum control gives robust high-fidelity operation1 and the bulk topology of quantum Hall system leads to the quantization of the Hall conductivity to better than one part in a billion2. Topological order is quantified in terms of singularities called topological defects that reside in an extended parameter space. We engineered such a singularity - a non-Abelian Yang monopole - using an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a five- dimensional parameter space. We quantified the topology of the monopole field by measuring the 1st Chern number – often simply called “the Chern number” - on an enclosing two-dimensional manifold, and by measuring the 2nd Chern number on an enclosing four-dimensional manifold. While the 1st Chern number vanished, the 2nd Chern number did not. Then, by displacing the manifold, we observed a transition from “topological” to “trivial” when the Yang monopole was no longer inside the manifold. Replicas of our system placed on a lattice opens the door for studying high energy phenomena governed by higher gauge symmetries than that of the U(1) symmetry of electrodynamics in an ideal platform.\r\n","speaker":{"name":"Ian Spielman","affiliation":" National Institute of Standards and Technology &amp; University of Maryland"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:11:08Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de926d9ed5dbfb329933f4","type":0,"title":"Diagrammatic Monte Carlo Method for Correlated System","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学理科楼B315"},"time":{"from":"2016-08-19T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-08-19T08:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&物理系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method is to stochastically sample the  configuration space in terms of perturbative Feynman diagrammatic series.

Frictional forces are crucial for determining the structural and mechanical properties of granular media in the solidlike state. To predict the functional form of the contact number with friction, we develop a theoretical description for mechanically stable frictional packings in terms of the difference between the total number of contacts required for isostatic packings of frictionless disks and the number of contacts in frictional packings, m= Nc,0 &#8722; Nc. The saddle order m represents the number of unconstrained degrees of freedom that a static packing would possess if friction were removed. Using a novel numerical method that allows us to enumerate disk packings for each m, we show that the probability to obtain a packing with saddle order m at a given static friction coefficient can be expressed as a power series. Using this form, we quantitatively describe the dependence of the average contact number on the friction coefficient for static disk packings obtained from direct simulations of the Cundall-Strack model.\r\n报告人简介：\r\nCorey S.

Such formulation enables us toachieve a controlled theoretical description for the spin liquid phases.We then show that the chiral spin liquid is indeed a gauged U(1) SPTphase. On the other hand, we also propose that the kagome spin liquid isa critical spin liquid phase, which can be considered as a gaugeddeconfined critical point (between a SPT and a superfluid phase).\r\nRefs: [1] Yin-Chen He, Subhro Bhattacharjee, R.

Experimentally it requires the preparation of a Fermi sea ofcold atoms that are confined by a shallow harmonic potential and atrapping of a few other atoms (that serve as magnetic impurities) inspecially designed optical potential. When there is anantiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the itinerant atoms inthe Fermi sea and the localized magnetic impurity it gives rise to theKondo effect. \r\nThe first problem employs the fact that fermionic atoms can have spin$s&gt;\\frac{1}{2}$ and thereby the magnetic impurity is over-screened. Atlow temperature, such system displays a non-Fermi liquid behaviour. Weestablish a theoretical analysis of interacting cold fermionic atomic systems that are governed by an effective Hamiltonian whose low energyphysics displays an over-screening by large spin. In addition, weindicate candidate systems in which it can be experimentally realized. \r\nIn the second part we explore and substantiate the feasibility ofrealizing the Coqblin-Schrieffer model in a gas of coldfermionic $^{173}$Yb atoms. Making use of different AC polarizabillityof the electronic ground state (electronic configuration$^1S_0$) and the long lived metastable state (electronic configuration$^3P_0$), it is substantiated that the latter can belocalized and serve as a magnetic impurity while the former remainsitinerant. The exchange mechanism between the itinerant$^1S_0$ and the localized $^3P_0$ atoms is analyzed and shown to beantiferromagnetic. The ensuing SU(6) symmetric Coqblin-SchriefferHamiltonian is constructed. A number of thermodynamic measurableobservables are calculated in the weak coupling regime $T&gt;T_K$ (usingperturbative RG analysis) and in the strong coupling regime $T(employing known Bethe ansatz techniques).","speaker":{"name":"Y.

By that time, III-nitride alloys was regarded the least possible candidate due to various \"impossible\" difficulties. However, a series of unexpected breakthroughs in 1990's totally changed people's view angle. Finally, the first high efficient blue LEDs were invented and commercialized at the same time of 1993. Nowadays, III-nitride-based LEDs have become the most widely used light source in many applications. The LED light bulbs are more than ten times efficient than incandescent bulb, and they last for 50 years! At their current adoption rates, by 2020, LEDs can reduce the world’s need for electricity by the equivalent of nearly 60 nuclear power plants. \r\nThe history of the invention of blue LED and future lighting will be described.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker: Shuji Nakamura obtained B.E., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from theUniversity of Tokushima in 1977, 1979, and 1994, respectively.

In 1991,he originally obtained p-type GaN films by thermal annealing and clarified the Hydrogenpassivation as a hole compensation mechanism. In 1992, he grew the first InGaN single crystal layers which havebeen used for an emitting layer of all of the blue/green/white LEDs and the violet/blue/green semiconductor lasers. In1993 and 1995 he developed the first group-III nitride-based high-brightness blue/green LEDs and violet laser diodes(LDs). In 1996, Nichia started selling white LEDs based on his invention of blue LEDs. These white LEDs have beenused for all kinds of lighting applications in order to save energy consumptions.

The most important application of GaN and related nitride materials has been the development of blue LEDs. Portable game machines, cellular phones and smart phones are very common items, especially among young people. The world’s first portable game machine was released in 1979 and cellular phones first became commercially available in 1984. However, until the end of the 1990s, all the displays of portable game machines and cellular phones were monochrome. Thus, it should be emphasized that the younger generation can now enjoy full-color portable games and cellular/smart phones because of the development of blue LEDs. Today, the applications of blue LEDs are not limited to displays. In combination with yellow phosphors, blue LEDs can act as a white light source and are used in general lighting. By 2020, about three-quarters of the incandescent and fluorescent lamps in Japan will have been replaced with LED lighting systems, resulting in a reduction of electricity consumption by 7% in principle. Therefore, I would like to recommend that people in China to use LED lighting systems to reduce CO2 emissions. Today, more than 1.3 billion people live in China and the consumption of coal\r\nin China exceeds half of the total world consumption. By using LED lighting systems, you can reduce the consumption of coal and CO2 emissions.\r\nThe applications of GaN and related materials are not limited to blue LEDs. They can be used for deep-UV (DUV) LEDs by utilizing Al-containing AlGaN. According to a UNICEF report, 663 million people still cannot drink safe water, and 2.4 billion people do not use safe sanitation facilities. In addition, global warming is causing an increase in the number of bacteria in drinking water even in developed countries. AlGaN-based DUV LEDs are effective for the low-cost and simple sterilization of water. Recently, DUV LEDs with an output power of over 50 mW/chip have been realized, and can now be installed in compact water purification systems.\r\nAnother application of these materials is laser diodes (LDs). Nitride-based violet LDs are the light source of the large-capacity optical storage systems called Blu-ray discs. Today, nitride-based LDs combined with phosphors can be used for the long-distance beam headlamps of vehicles. This material system is also useful for electron devices. In mobile or smart phone base stations, high-frequency RF amplifiers employing GaAs-based heterojunction field-effect transistors (HFETs) are being replaced with those employing GaN-based HFETs\r\nbecause of their capability of higher-power operation. By replacing Si-based insulated gate bipolar transistors and super-junction MOSFET power devices with GaN-based power devices in inverter and converter circuits, we can expect a 9.8% reduction in electricity consumption in Japan.\r\nIn this presentation, I would like to explain the future prospects for new applications of group III nitride semiconductors and their contribution to establishing a sustainable society.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll are welcome. \r\n\r\n","speaker":{"name":"Hiroshi Amano","affiliation":" 2014 Nobel Laureate in Physics Director, Center for Integrated Research of Future Electronics  (CIRFE) Institute of Materials and Systems for Sustainability  (IMaSS), Akasaki Research Center Venture Business Laboratory, Nagoya University"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:11:41Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de928f9ed5dbfb32993407","type":0,"title":"Image-Based Mesh Generation and Volumetric T-Spline Modeling for Isogeometric Analysis with Engineering Applications","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学李兆基科技大楼A248"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-30T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"\r\nYongjie Jessica Zhang\r\nProfessor in Mechanical Engineering\r\nCourtesy Appointment in Biomedical Engineering\r\nCarnegie Mellon University\r\n\r\nShort Bio:\r\nYongjie Jessica Zhang received her B.Eng. in Automotive Engineering, and M.Eng. in Engineering Mechanics from Tsinghua University, China; and M.Eng. in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics and Ph.D. in Computational Engineering and Sciences from The University of Texas at Austin. \r\nHer research interests include computational geometry, mesh generation, computer graphics, visualization, finite element method, isogeometric analysis and their application in computational biomedicine, material sciences and engineering.

For seasonal variation critically important for hydrology and water resources, we illustrate from the 12-year MODIS satellite dataset analysis that the snow albedo reduction from March to April is caused in part by the deposition of absorbing aerosols associated with an increase in aerosol optical depth over the Sierra Nevada in the Western United States and the Southern Tibetan Plateau. In addition to global warming, the reduction of mountain snow cover must be related to interactions of 3D topography and incoming solar radiation as well as the deposition of black carbon (BC), and dust particles. \r\n\r\nWe then describe the 3D solar radiative transfer over inhomogeneous and complex topography by means of Monte Carlo photon tracing calculations and its correlation parameterization using a number of key parameters defined by the position vector with reference to the sun over a mountain slope in terms of direct and diffuse fluxes, including mountain to mountain interactions. This is followed by a brief discussion of parameterization of the spectral light absorption and scattering by BC/snow system in terms of the extinction coefficient, single-scattering albedo, and asymmetry factor for snow grains contaminated by BCs during their aging processes in the atmosphere. For multiple BC internal mixing, we have innovated a stochastic process to place coated BCs of various sizes within the 3D snow grain domain using BC mass as input in view of the fact that physical equations to define internal mixing do not exist.\r\n\r\nThe effects of 3D radiative transfer and snow albedo reduction induced by internal BC absorption are illustrated by a number of model simulations. The first involves the use of GEOS-Chem with a resolution of ~ 200 km for the study of the impact of BC deposition on snow reduction and radiative forcing analysis. In the second, we employed CCSM4, a global model with a resolution of 0.9o x 1.25o for a 10-year climate run to investigate the 3D radiative transfer impact on cloud, snowmelt, runoff, temperature, and circulation patterns over the Tibetan Plateau in winter and summer. In the third, we modified WRF-Chem to include both BC deposition and 3D topography to study their impacts on precipitation over mountain regions in the Western United States using a Pineapple Express case. A number of pertinent results are presented and physically discussed. Finally, we present a preliminary unification of the evolution of BC in the atmosphere produced by anthropogenic emission and its dry and wet depositions onto snow grains over the Tibetan Plateau, using the widely-known Noah-MP land surface model as a prototype to study the impact of BC on snow albedo reduction and feedback.

We present a model whose energy spectrum exhibits a nodal line acting as a vortex ring; this in turn is linked by a pseudospin structure akin to that of a smoke ring. Contrary to a Weyl point node spectrum, the vortex ring gives rise to skyrmionic pseudospin patterns in cuts on both sides of the nodal ring plane; this pattern covers the full Brillouin zone, thus leading to a new, `maximal', anomalous Hall effect in a 3D semimetal. Tuning a model parameter shrinks the vortex ring until it vanishes, giving way to a pair of Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. This establishes a connection between two distinct momentum-space topologies - that of a vortex ring (a circle of singularity) and a monopole-anti-monopole pair (two point singularities). We present the model both as a low-energy continuum and a two-band tight-binding lattice model. This talk is based on arXiv:1606.00982by L.-K. Lim and R.

Agitation and fluidization of dense solid-liquid suspensions are common ways of enhancing transfer rates. Suspensions have large interfacial area and the slip velocities between the phases help in transporting chemical species towards and away from the interfaces where in many cases surface-reactions occur. We present detailed simulations of flow dynamics and mass transfer in dense suspensions with explicit resolution of the solid-liquid interfaces. Solid and liquid dynamics are directly coupled through no-slip conditions at the solid particle surfaces and the (resolved) hydrodynamic forces and torques that translate and rotate the particles. The simulations are based on a lattice-Boltzmann scheme equipped with an immersed boundary method (the latter for imposing no-slip at solid surfaces) that captures the two-phase flow dynamics, and a finite-volume scheme on coupled overlapping domains (COD) for mass transfer. In COD, fine “inner” grids around the particles resolve the thin scalar boundary layers that are the result of high Schmidt numbers in the liquid. The inner grids communicate with a courser background grid. We show – amongst more - the intimate relation between flow conditions and local and overall mass transfer rates in fixed and fluidized beds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBio: Jos Derksen has a PhD degree (1991) from Eindhoven University of Technology (Netherlands).

Graphene is the best known 2D material and is a zero-band gap semiconductor. However, there are a whole family of 2D materials that offer different properties to graphene, such as direct band gap semiconductors and insulators. These new 2D materials are set to expand the capability beyond what graphene alone can achieve and drive 2D materials into industry. In this talk I will discuss the recent work on monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (MoS2 and WS2), which are direct band gap semiconductors that emit light in the visible spectrum. These are grown directly onto silicon wafers using scalable chemical vapour deposition methods with single crystal sizes up to 0.5mm. These TMDs have large exciton binding energy and enable the observation of trions and biexcitons using photoluminescence spectroscopy. Interactions with defect states will also be discussed. I will discuss our recent work on heterostructures of different 2D materials, formed by vertical stacking or lateral stacking, creating new systems with engineered excitonic dynamics for photodetectors, transistors, and light emitting devices fabricated at the nanoscale. Atomic resolution studies of defects in TMDs is studied using aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy, where single sulfur vacancies are detected and their dynamics of aggregation tracked in real time. I will show how we can probe substitutional dopants and adatoms that play major roles in n-type doping of transistors and enhanced catalytic properties. This talk will cover the aspects of TMDs from synthesis, characterization to implementation in nanoscale devices for wafer-scale electronics.","speaker":{"name":"Jamie Warner","affiliation":" Department of Materials Oxford University","position":"教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:12:08Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92aa9ed5dbfb32993418","type":0,"title":"Directing Crystallization and Assembly at Structured Interfaces","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学工程系工物馆324(A)会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-15T01:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-15T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学工程系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"海报-2.jpg海报-2-1.jpg","speaker":{"name":"Ying Diao(刁莹)","affiliation":" University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA","position":"博士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:12:10Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92ac9ed5dbfb32993419","type":0,"title":"工程物理系第180期“工物学术论坛”：Measuring the Leptonic Dirac CP Phase with Muon Decay at Rest","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学刘卿楼104会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-14T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-14T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"工程物理系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"报告With the 1-3 mixing angle measured at reator neutrino experiments Daya Bay and RENO, there are still three unknown oscillation variables: the neutrino mass hierarchy, the octant of the atmospheric mixing angle, and the leptonic CP phase. Of these three, the CP phase is the most difficult to be measured precisely and important for distinguishing flavor symmetries. I will first review the status of CP measurement and then introduce a new proposal with muon decay at rest (muDAR). Currently, accelerator neutrino experiments such as T2K, NOvA, and DUNE are the most promising for CP measurement. Nevertheless, they suffer from several problems of degeneracy, efficiency, sensitivity, and theoretical armbiguities such as non-unitarity mixing (NUM) and non-standard interaction (NSI). The situation can be improved by adding a muon decay at rest (muDAR) source. With T2(H)K running in neutrino mode and muDAR in anti-neutrino mode, both using the same detector, the CP measurement becomes more precise can break the degeneracy between \\delta and 180^o - \\delta. Most importantly, muDAR can guarantee the CP sensitivity against NUM and NSI. The same configuration can also apply to next-generation medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments like JUNO and RENO-50, enhancing their physics potential from just mass hierarchy to also CP. With only one source and no extra detectors, this dessign is much better than DAEdLAS which requires 3 sources, but only 20% duty factor and 4 times higher luminosity for each.\r\n报告人简介：葛韶锋，德国马克斯.普朗克研究所（海德堡）博士后研究员，日本高能加速器研究机构（KEK）科学振兴会（JSPS）博士后研究员（2012-2014），清华高能物理中心博士（2006-2012）。研究领域：中微子、电弱破缺、暗物质的理论及实验唯象研究。\r\n第180期“论坛”主请人联系方式：何红建 62773916 hjhe@tsinghua.edu.cn","speaker":{"name":"Shao-Feng Ge","affiliation":" Max Planck Institute - Heidelberg, Germany","position":"博士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:12:12Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92ad9ed5dbfb3299341b","type":0,"title":"材料院《材料科学论坛》：Smart Biomaterials for Regenerative Engineering","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学材料院学术报告厅（逸夫技术科学楼1－205）"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-14T06:30:00Z","to":"2016-07-14T07:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"材料院《材料科学论坛》联系人：赵凌云老师 13699268273","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"\r\nFellow, American Institute for Medical &amp; Biological Engineering, Laura H.

In this talk I will discuss two recent examples to illustrate how first-principles calculations can be used to yield new insights into both types of factors, and provide strategies for alloy design. We will consider first the ideal tensile strength and corresponding intrinsic ductility for group 5 and 6 metal-based refractory alloys forming with body-centered cubic (bcc) structures. Group 6 metals, such as Mo and W, are intrinsically brittle, and this limits their applications. Our first-principles calculations show that alloying group 6 transition metals with group 4 or 5 transition metals can transform these materials into ones that display intrinsically ductile behavior. Remarkably, this transformation in ductility can be understood as an electron filling effect with the intrinsically ductile response the manifestation of a Jahn-Teller distortion. The second example will be devoted to hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Ti, where it is known that very small concentrations of O interstitials can induce significant strengthening, but with the detrimental effect of lowering toughness. To provide new insights into this long-studied problem, we performed first-principles calculations to analyze the interactions between interstitial atoms and screw dislocation cores in hcp-Ti. Both indirect studies of generalized stacking fault energy and direct investigate of dislocation core show that oxygen and other large interstitials are strongly repelled by the screw dislocation core. This repulsion would forces these interstitials to “diffuse” from their original interstitial site during dislocation slip. The origin of this repulsion is the low symmetry structure of hcp lattice: in the hcp-Ti screw dislocation core, the interstitial volume is largely reduced. The results are shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations derived from in-situ small-scale mechanical tests.References:1.L Qi, DC Chrzan, “Tuning Ideal Tensile Strengths and Intrinsic Ductility of bcc Refractory Alloys,” Physical review letters, 112 (11), 115503 (2014).2.Q Yu, L Qi, T Tsuru, R Traylor, D Rugg, JW Morris, M Asta, DC Chrzan, A Minor, “Origin of dramatic oxygen solute strengthening effect in titanium,” Science, 347 (6222), 635-639 (2015)3.L Qi, T Tsuru, M Asta, DC Chrzan, “Interactions between Oxygen Interstitial and -Type Screw Dislocations in alpha-Titanium” (arXiv:1502.05129 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci])\r\nCV_Liang_Qi.pdf","speaker":{"name":"齐亮","affiliation":" Department of Materials Science and Engineering,  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor","position":"博士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:12:15Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92b19ed5dbfb3299341e","type":0,"title":"材料院《材料科学论坛》：Multifunctional Fe@Au Nanoparticles for Cancer Theranostics","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学材料院学术报告厅（逸夫技术科学楼1－205）"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-13T05:30:00Z","to":"2016-07-13T06:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"材料院《材料科学论坛》联系人：王秀梅老师 62782966","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"\r\nIron nanoparticles have been used as negative contrast agents for T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging due to their high relaxivity and low toxicity. Gold nanoparticles possess good biocompatibility and unique optical property. In this study, we fabricated oval-shaped Fe@Au core-shell nanoparticles (oFe@Au NPs) by micro-emulsion method, and used 2-aminoethanethiol(-SH) modify the surface. Methotrexate (MTX), an anticancer drug, was further conjugated onto the oFe@Au-SH NPs. The multifunctional nanoparticles could be applied for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and photothermal therapy of cancers. The analysis result of superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (SQUID) showed that the oFe@Au NPs was superparamagnetic with a saturation magnetization value (Ms) of 13.7 emu/g. The oFe@Au NPs could shorten the T2 relaxation time of water protons and result in MRI contrast enhancement. In vitro MTT assay using mouse fibroblasts cell line (L929) was carried out and the results showed that the concentration of 500 μg/mL oFe@Au NPs did not have appreciable toxicity. UV/vis spectroscopy was used to investigate the optical property of the oFe@Au NPs. The oFe@Au NPs exhibited an absorption peak at 792 nm. We further used an 808 nm laser (2 W/cm2) to irradiate the oFe@Au NPs aqueous suspension. For 500 μg/mL oFe@Au NPs, after 360 s irradiation the temperature reached 53.1 oC. The result revealed that the oFe@Au NPs was amenable for photothermal therapy applications. Using optical coherence tomography, the three-dimensional images were clearer with higher concentration. Results of in vitro MTT assay using human colon cancer cell line (SW620) showed that only 37.9% cell survived with 500 μg/mL oFe@Au-MTX NPs and laser irradiation. In vivo study using SW620 implanted nude mouse presented promising results, and the tumors were totally eliminated in one week followed by 50 μg oFe@Au-MTX NPs injected and once 360 s 150 mW/cm2 laser irradiation.Brief Bio: Dr. Ren-Jei Chung is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology at National Taipei University of Technology, and also serves as the Vice Director in the Biomaterials Interdisciplinary Research Center.

There is thus a great need to determine the detailed properties of free IDPs, such that one can start to relate these properties to function and understand how the ensemble-function relationship maybe perturbed in human diseases. Here, I want to present recent progresses from my lab towards reliable atomistic simulations of disordered protein ensembles. In particular, we have developed a multi-scale enhanced sampling (MSES) technique that exploits efficient coarse-grained models to greatly accelerate the sampling of atomistic protein conformations. Development of MSES has also allowed us to re-optimize a generalized Born with molecular volume (GBMV) implicit solvent force field, which can now recapitulate the stability and structure of a wide range of helical and beta-hairpin peptides. Importantly, the new force field is largely free of the over-compaction problem suffered by many current implicit as well as explicit solvent force fields. We are very optimistic that development of these advanced sampling and implicit solvent methods has paved the way for one to start to examine the ensemble-function-disease relationship of many important IDPs at the atomistic level.个人简历： 见附件。 JChen-shortCV.pdf","speaker":{"name":"Jianhan Chen(陈建涵)","affiliation":" Kansas State University","bio":"见附件。

rechargeable batteries for electric transportation and grid storage. At the foundation of these batteries are innovative material designs to control the behaviors of ions, electrons, and redox reactions. In the first part of this presentation, I will show our recent work using an interlayer expansion approach to overcome the large Mg2+ ion diffusion barrier to significantly enhance the diffusivity in Mg rechargeable batteries. Theory, synthesis, electrochemical measurements, and kinetic analysis are combined to improve Mg diffusion behavior in MoS2, which is a poor Mg transporting material in its pristine form. The expansion boosts Mg conductivity by two orders of magnitude, effectively enabling the otherwise barely active MoS2 to approach its theoretical storage capacity as well as to achieve one of the highest rate capabilities. The discovery will lead to novel mechanisms and material designs for multivalent ion storage and open the way to high-energy-density, low-cost and safe batteries. In the second part, I will demonstrate a “π-conjugated redox polymer” simultaneously featuring a π-conjugated backbone and integrated redox sites, which can be stably and reversibly n-doped to a high doping level of 2.0 with significantly enhanced electronic conductivity. P(NDI2OD-T2) delivers 95% of its theoretical capacity at a high rate of 100C (72 s per charge?discharge cycle) under practical measurement conditions as well as 96% capacity retention after 3000 cycles of deep discharge?charge. Electrochemical, impedance, and charge-transport measurements unambiguously demonstrate that the ultrafast electrode kinetics of P(NDI2OD-T2) are attributed to the high electronic conductivity of the polymer in the heavily n-doped state. Further modification on chemical structures improves specific capacity over 200 mAh/g while maintaining faster electrode kinetics. \r\nBiographyYan Yao is the Robert A.

Currently there are strong efforts to develop novel environmentally benign lead-free relaxor materials. The structural origins of the relaxor state and the role of composition modifications in these lead-free materials are still not well understood.In recent years solid-state NMR spectroscopy, combined with quantum-chemical modelling, is evolving into a key technique for the investigation of these important materials. In the first part of the talk we give a brief introduction into the relevant techniques of solid-state NMR spectroscopy.Next we demonstrate how these techniques were employed to tackle thepreviously unsolved question on the structure of relaxor ferroelectrics at the atomic level by characterizing lead-free piezoceramic solid solutions (100-x)(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3-xBaTiO3(BNT-xBT) (for x=1,4,6, and 15). Based on the relative intensity between spectral components in quadrupolar perturbed 23Na Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), we present direct evidence of the coexistence of cubic and polar local symmetries in these relaxor ferroelectrics. In addition to that, we demonstrate how the cubic phase vanishes whenever a ferroelectric state is induced, either by field-cooling or changing dopant amount, supporting the relation between this cubic phase and the relaxor state.In the next step the spectral properties of the non-cubic portions are studied in detail. For the first time it is shown that the peculiar composition dependence of the EFG distribution width (ΔQISwidth) correlates strongly to the dispersion in dielectric permittivity, a fingerprint of the relaxor state. Significant disorder is found in the local structure of BNT-xBT, as indicated by the analysis of the electric field gradient (EFG) in 23Na 3QMAS NMR spectra.Finally an outlook and some first preliminary results on other classesof lead-free materialsare presented.\r\nBuntkowsky_CV_2016.pdf","speaker":{"name":"Gerd Buntkowsky","affiliation":" 1Institute of Physical Chemistry, and2Institute of Materials Science,  Technical University Darmstadt","position":"教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:12:44Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92ce9ed5dbfb3299342f","type":0,"title":"Supramolecular Imaging","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学工程系英士楼201会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-06T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学工程系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"学术报告通知20160706.doc","speaker":{"name":"崔宏刚","affiliation":" The Johns Hopkins University","position":"教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:12:46Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92cf9ed5dbfb32993430","type":0,"title":"Architecture at the nanoscale: Engineering next-generation catalysts for energy applications","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学工程系工物馆324(A)会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-06T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-06T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学工程系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"学术报告—Yuriy-张贴-2016-7.docx","speaker":{"name":"Yuriy Román-Leshkov","affiliation":" Massachusetts Institute of Technology","position":"教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:12:47Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92d19ed5dbfb32993431","type":0,"title":"金涌院士学术活动报告会：从诺贝尔奖谈创新思维","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学甲所第三会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-05T11:00:00Z","to":"2016-07-05T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"校学术委员会","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"\r\n请各位感兴趣的师生点击下方网址报名！谢谢！\r\n报名网址：http://www.diaochapai.com/survey1750177\r\n\r\n金涌院士简介：\r\n1935年7月生于北京。清华大学教授，中国工程院院士。1959年毕业于原苏联乌拉尔工业大学。国务院学位委员会化工学科评议组召集人（第四届至第六届）。北京市政府专业顾问（第三届至第六届）、中国颗粒学会、中国化工学会常务理事、中国环境学会顾问，中国生态经济学会副理事长。北京化工大学、哈尔滨工业大学、西安交通大学等校兼职教授。长期从事化学反应工程、流态化反应工程教学与研究工作。在国内外发表学术论文400余篇，获技术专利37项。研究领域有气固湍动流态化和高速流化床反应器、团聚流态化、气液固三相流化床反应器、颗粒粉体技术等。曾获人事部中青年有突出贡献专家称号、全国优秀教师奖、全国五一劳动奖章、北京市教学名师奖。先后获国家技术发明二等奖1项、国家科技进步二等奖1项、部委级科技进步一、二等奖10余项、全国优秀博士论文指导教师奖2次，获2006美国化学工程师学会PSRI讲座奖(AIChE PSRI, Lectureship Award)。事迹被收入 Who’s Who in the World、《中国当代名人录》。","speaker":{"name":"金涌","affiliation":"","position":"院士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:12:49Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de92d39ed5dbfb32993432","type":0,"title":"2016清华大学许宝騄讲座","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学近春园西楼三楼报告厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-07-05T08:30:00Z","to":"2016-07-05T09:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"丘成桐数学科学中心","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"2016清华大学许宝騄讲座\r\n\r\n报告人：Lawrence D.

In conventional notation these are the X-values, and the observations are the Y-values. In many conventional discussions of these models and their applications the X-values are treated as fixed constants even though the data itself is more realistically modeled as coming from a population yielding random covariates.\r\n\r\nIs it really OK to condition on the observed values of the randomly distributed covariates and treat them as if they were fixed? The short answer is that it is sometimes OK and it is sometimes not OK. A key part of the answer depends on whether the analytical linear model or GLM is an accurate representation of the stochastic nature of the data or is “mis-specified”. This talk will characterize answers to this basic question and describe valid alternative forms and targets of inference for situations involving random covariates. A key feature of the development is imposition of very minimal assumptions on the true distributions in the stochastic model for the data. In that sense the framework is “assumption-lean”.\r\n\r\nConsequences related to this issue in linear models lead to alternative inference for the Average Treatment Effect in randomized clinical trials, to alternative forms of the popular C_p criterion for model selection, and to improved estimates and predictions in semi-supervised learning. Most of the current talk will be devoted to an exposition of the main issue – the role of random covariates in standard methodology. Some of the consequences for specific modes of application will be discussed as time permits. Details related to C_p will be discussed in the next lecture.\r\nThis is joint research of the Wharton Linear Models Research Group whose members include Buja, A.; Berk, R. A.; Brown, L. D.; George, E.; Pitkin, E.; Traskin, M.; Zhang, K.; and Zhao, L. \r\n\r\n\r\nLecture 2: Mallows Cp for Realistic Out-of-sample Prediction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMallows’ Cp is a frequently used tool for variable selection in linear models. (For the original discussion see Mallows (1973), building on Mallows (1964, 1966).) In practice it may be used in conjunction with forward stepwise selection or all-subsets selection, or some other selection scheme. It can be derived and interpreted as an estimate of (normalized) predictive squared error in a very special situation. Two key features of that situation are: 1) The observed covariate variables and the covariates for the predictive population are, “not to be regarded as being sampled randomly from some population, but rather are taken as fixed design variables”.

Assumption 1) does not accord with most of the common statistical settings in which Cp is employed, and assumption 2) is often undesirably optimistic in practical settings. \r\n\r\nWe derive an easily computed variant of Mallows expression that does not rely on either of these assumptions. The new variant, denoted as , estimates the predictive squared error for future observations drawn from the same population as that which provided the observed statistical sample. The candidate estimators are linear estimators based on selected variables. But there are virtually no assumptions on the true sampling distribution. \r\nUse of this variant will be demonstrated via simulations in a simple regression setting that enables easy visualization and also exact computation of some relevant quantities. For a more practical demonstration we also apply the methodology to variable selection in a data set involving criminal sentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Lawrence D. Brown\r\n\r\nLawrence D.

Although featureless paramagnet phases are not ruled out by any existing theorem, field theoretic arguments disfavor their existence.

Previously, information of the grain-scale property coupling of elastic strain and domain switching behavior under electric fields has been inferred from the bulk properties of an electro-ceramic material. Here, grain resolved scattering methods have been used to investigate the phase and domain structure of individual grains within bulk polycrystalline electro-ceramic samples under electric field. Example materials are chosen which undergo contrasting strain mechanisms including field-induced phase transformations, and ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain switching.The data obtained show that the grain orientation with respect to the applied electric field vector dictates both the induced phase and degree of domain texturing observed within a given grain. Such knowledge will be of potential benefit to the future engineering of high-strain actuators, but also has implications for all polycrystalline ferroic devices.\r\nDaniels_CV.PDF","speaker":{"name":"J.E.

Renewable energy could play a basic role to meet present energy demands and mitigate global warming. Agricultural biomass represents an attractive and suitable feedstock for energy conversion, particularly in rural areas and can also play a fundamental role in preserving or improving soil quality. Carbon sequestration and soil quality improvement coupled with bio-energy generation are important issues to be addressed and properly face the mitigation of global climate change. Therefore, a trade-off between atmospheric CO2 sequestration into long-persistent soil carbon pools and the development of carbon-neutral fuel sources should be achieved. Biomass thermochemical conversion processes have several advantages over other methods, in terms of feedstock flexibility and energy co-products diversification. Particularly in rural areas, decentralized energy systems operating at small scale, fuelled with processing wastes and locally available residues can combine heat and power generation (CHP units). The development of small scale sustainable symbiotic thermochemical-based systems fuelled with residues and wastes are analysed here. Several paradigms are depicted related to closings loops, closing bio-resource efficiency in order to find a win–win solution. Pyrolysis and gasification pilot plants fuelled with residues and wastes designed and constructed by AUTh group and funded by EU will be also presented.\r\nKeywords：Closing Resources Cycles, Circular Economy, thermochemical-based systems, residues, wastes\r\nShort CV：Anastasia Zabaniotou is Professor at the Chemical Engineering Department of the Faculty of Engineering of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

Energy consumption by these process can also be responsible for a sizeable portion of the total carbon footprint of the product life cycle.\r\nIn an era of steadily increasing energy prices and concerns over the environmental impacts of energy use, energy efficiency can offer one of the best approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve profitability. In the production of potato crisps, frying consumes more than 90% of the total processing energy requirement so the greatest potential for energy savings is offered by design and control optimisation to minimise heat input to the potato slices and reduce thermal losses. Optimisation of the frying process requires good knowledge and understanding of the heat and mass transfer processes involved and their influence on product quality, safety, product throughput and energy consumption. \r\n报告人简介：Dr Hongwei Wu received his BEng (1st Class Honours, 1998), and PhD (2004) with specialisation in Mechanical and Thermal Engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (now Beihang University), China.

Here I will present our results on transport measurements on high mobility few-layer graphene and phosphorene devices. In bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with mobility as high as 400,000 cm2/V, we observe intrinsic gapped states at the charge neutrality point, arising from electronic interactions. This state is identified to be a layer antiferromagnetic state with broken time reversal symmetry. In another few-layer graphene system, ABA-stacked trilayer graphene consists of multiple Dirac bands, where crystal symmetry protects the spin degenerate counter-propagating edge modes resulting in σxx = 4e2/h. At even higher magnetic fields, the crystal symmetry is broken in by electron-electron interactions and the &#61550;=0 quantum Hall state develops an insulating phase with non-monotonic dependence on temperature and magnetic field. Our findings indicate the role of crystal and spin symmetry in generation of topological phases in multiple Dirac bands. At finite doping, we explore the tunable integer and fractional quantum Hall states and Landau level crossings in these few-layer systems. Finally, I will present our recent results on quantum oscillations and weak localization in air-stable, few-layer phosphorene devices. Our results underscore the fascinating many-body physics in these 2D membranes.\r\n\r\n个人简介：Chun Ning (Jeanie) Lau is a Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University of California, Riverside.

The polar dielectric SrTiO3 (STO) exhibits such an energetic phonon mode and the 2DEG is created both when one unit cell FeSe layer is grown on its (100) surface and on the interface with another dielectric like LaAlO3 (LAO). We obtain a quantitative description of both systems by solving the gap equation for Tc for arbitrary Fermi energy, electron-phonon coupling and the phonon frequency, and direct (RPA) electron-electron repulsion strength. The high temperature superconductivity in 1UCFeSe/STO is possible due to a combination of three factors: high LO phonon frequency, large electron-phonon coupling and huge dielectric constant of the substrate suppression the Coulomb repulsion.\r\nPart two: We use Ginzburg-Landau theory to study the transport of 2D superconductors.

In order to meet the demands of Indian space missions.TheLaboratory for Hypersonic and Shock Wave Research,which is the biggest laboratory in India with more than three dozen research students pursuing the PhD degreeshas successfully built major hypersonic testfacilities in the past two decades.I will present an overview of these major facilities and typical results obtained from our recent research work.\r\n报告人简介：\r\nProfessor in department of aerospace engineering at Indian institute of science.

However, in contrast to ideal, defectless, single layer layer graphene, the presence of defects in graphene as well as stacking as few or multilayer assemblies changes completely the properties of these materials, converting it into semiconductor exhibiting photocatalytic properties. The initial use of graphenes in photocatalysis was as additive of semiconductors to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Latter, it was realized that graphene oxide can behave itself as a semiconductor with UV photoresponse. A natural evolution has been to develop visible light photoresponsive graphene semiconductors. In this presentation, a new procedure for defective graphene films preparation with semiconducting properties for overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial electron donor or for CO2 reduction will be shown. The process is based on the use of suitable natural polymers that can form films of nanometric thickness essentially defect-free with subnanometric roughness. Pyrolysis of these films can render few-layers graphene and even single layer graphene, depending on the concentration and speed of the spin coating employed in film preparation. If the natural biopolymer contains N or sulfur in its composition, then, the resulting graphene can be doped, with a doping content that essentially depends on the pyrolysis conditions.While graphene is a conductive material, the presence of dopant elements converts then into semiconductor and, as consequence, they undergo charge separation when they are illuminated with light of wavelength shorter than the band gap. These semiconducting doped graphenes can be used for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water in the absence of any metal.[1, 2] However, the presence of metals acting as co-catalysts increases the efficiency of the materials for hydrogen generation.In this presentation, data will be presented showing that it is possible to prepare oriented metal nanoparticles on few-layers graphene and that the resulting material has a record efficiency for the overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial electron donors.[3-5] In addition, these materials can also be useful to promote the Sabatier methanation of CO2, the photocatalytic activity being dependent on the temperature of the system.References.[1] M.

Also, the IC architecture has been explored for other optoelectronic devices such as infrared photodetectors and photovoltaic cells [4-7]. Combination of interband transition and fast carrier transport in IC structures provides more flexibilities and advantages to achieve high device performance for photodetectors and photovoltaic cells.

Most of research is presently focused on inorganic multiferroics, whose physics and intrinsic limitations are fairly well understood. Comparatively, investigation on molecular multiferroics is still limited. Here [1] we introduce a new family of multifunctional molecular materials where new physics and new properties, including ferromagnetic and multiferroic behavior, emerge due to a subtle interplay between intramolecular electron transfer (IET) and intermolecular charge transfer (CT). Intermolecular CT interactions govern the behavior of CT salts, a large and widely investigated family of molecular materials, whose physics is driven by strongly correlated electrons on soft lattices in reduced dimensions, leading to multistability, photoinduced phase transitions, structural and electrical instabilities, charge ordering etc. CT salts span the whole range from insulators to metals and superconductors. Ferroelectricity was demonstrated and is actively investigated in several families of CT salts. IET is the key phenomenon in a variety of dyes and conjugated polymers that find use in OLED, organic solar cells and are exploited for their large nonlinear optical responses in bioimaging, nanofabrication, etc. The large nonlinearity of the responses of conjugated materials with low lying IET degrees of freedom shows up with a large and nontrivial sensitivity to the environment that eventually drives the system towards the rare, intriguing and technologically relevant phenomenon of multistability. Starting from chargetransfer crystals with a mixed stack motif, widely investigate for their ferroelectric behavior, we demonstrate via theoretical modelling that, decorating the crystal with stable organic radicals, it is possible to fine tune the CT and IET interplay as to obtain molecular materials with ferromagnetic as well as multiferroic behavior.\r\n[1] Di Maiolo, F.; Sissa, C.; Painelli, A.; Combining intra- and intermolecular charge-transfer: a new strategy towards molecular ferromagnets and multiferroics.

Unobstructed optical access is achieved by matching the optical refractive indices of the casing, the blade, and the working fluid. \r\nThe flow in the blade tip region is dominated by the tip leakage flow and tip leakage vortex (TLV). The leakage flow, driven by the pressure difference across the blade, passes through the narrow tip gap and emerges into the rotor passage like a jet with high axial and circumferential momentum. At the early stage, this flow separates from the casing and rolls up into the TLV near the blade suction side. Later on, the TLV detaches from the blade due to vortex-wall interaction, and the leakage flow penetrates deeply into the passage, generating a three dimensional shear layer at its interface with the forward passage flow and a boundary layer near the casing. Both of them are entrained into the TLV after the endwall boundary layer separation. \r\nTurbulence in the tip region is highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous. It is generated primarily by the shear production in the shear layer and the contraction associated with the leakage flow separation. Consequently, turbulence kinetic energy peaks at these regions, but it is also elevated in other areas such as the TLV center due to the mean flow convection and low local dissipation rate. The vortex bursting and the vortex-blade interaction alter the production and turbulence energy significantly. Moreover, the unsteady motion of large scale coherent structures forms a significant fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy in the TLV core.\r\nBrief Biography：\r\nDr. Huixuan Wu has been an assistant professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, &#8232;University of Kansas, USA, since 2015.

Existing methods are either only suitable for small scale systematic synthesis, oversimplifying the nodal dynamics, lack of performance guarantees or fail to adapt to changing environments. \r\nThis motivates our research aiming at a scalable, correct-by-construction formal design methodology for distributed cooperative systems. In particular, we focus on a formal design of multi-robot systems that can guarantee the accomplishment of high-level team missions through automatic synthesis of local coordination mechanisms and control laws. \r\nOur basic idea is to decompose the team mission into individual subtasks such that the design can be reduced to local synthesis problems for individual robots, and then solving these local synthesis problems by composing predesigned and verified reactive motion/action primitives of robots. Multidisciplinary approaches combining control theory, machine learning and computational verification are utilized to achieve this goal. \r\nThe developed theory will enable robots in the team to cooperatively learn their individual roles in a mission, and then automatically synthesize local task and mission plans to fulfill \r\ntheir subtasks. A salient feature of the proposed method lies on its ability to handle environmental uncertainties and un-modeled dynamics, as we do not require an explicit model \r\nof the transition dynamics of each agent and their interactions with the environment. In addition, the design is on-line and reactive enabling the robot team to adapt to changing environments and dynamic tasking.\r\n\r\nBio-sketch: Hai Lin is currently an associate professor at the Department of \r\nElectrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, where he got his Ph.D. in 2005.

In this epoch the Universe was dark, cold and opaque. However, it underwent a phase transition where the neutral gas was re-ionised when the first stars began to shine and the first quasars emerged. The Universe then became transparent, allowing starlight to travel through large distances and reach us. The reionisation era is one of the least understood periods in the cosmological history. It is where galaxies, like our Milky Way, were in their infancy stages, rapidly turning the gases trapped within into luminous stars. In this talk I will discuss the ionisation proecesses in the protogalaxies and their host enviroments, caused by irradiation of UV/X-rays from massive stars and accreting sources and by the bombardment of ultra-high-energy particles generated in the violent processes that are associated with star formation and accretion. I will also show how the ionisation fronts form, develop and propagate. The impacts on our understand of structual formation in the young Univserse will be discussed. \r\nBrief Biography：Prof. Kinwah Wu is the Head of Theory at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London (UCL) in UK.

The IoT wireless sensor nodes need to be maintenance free and operate continuously, which will have to rely on energy harvesting for power. In this talk, we propose online discrete rate and power adaption policies for an energy harvesting communication of IoT wireless sensor nodes. The receiver periodically sends 1-bit feedback by comparing the channel power gain with a predetermined threshold. The transmitter correspondingly adjusts QAM level and transmission power based on the 1-bit feedback and the available battery energy. To determine the optimal channel threshold, adaptive M-QAM level and corresponding power allocation, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize the throughput within a finite horizon. We further propose an efficient but suboptimal discrete rate and power policy. Our results show that the performance loss is negligible for the simple M-QAM adaption of the suboptimal policy that is attributed to the optimal choice of channel threshold.\r\n\r\n讲演者简介\r\n\r\nDr. Wei Zhang (F’15) received the Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2005.

These are (i) droplet-based microfluidics, (ii) opto/electric droplet manipulation, and (iii) opto/electric particle manipulation. I will present the fundamental principles behind these methods, what their capabilities are, and what their potential uses are. The talk will review: \r\n(i)Droplet-based microfluidics: we have developed all on-chip methods of pumping, mixing, and combinatorial chemistry. The most exciting recent development is our ability to produce a sequence of hundreds of droplets with a gradient of a desired compound. This sequence of droplets can cover 4-6 orders of magnitude in the concentration of the compound and enables effective on-chip combinatorial chemistry. This technology is quite useful for constructing dose/response curves while consuming a minimum of potentially expensive samples and reagents as well as for minimizing human or even robotic involvement in constructing dose/response curves.\r\n(ii)Opto/electric droplet manipulation: using lasers and electric fields we can control and manipulation individual droplets to perform assays and other chemical operations. This method is similar to opto-electrowetting (OEW or EWOD) except that the “electrodes” used for the droplet manipulation are virtual electrodes whose locations are defined by dynamic laser light patterns rather than fixed, unmovable conventional electrodes.\r\n(iii)Opto/electric particle manipulation: using lasers and electric fields we can capture, concentrate, manipulate and sort populations of micro- and nanometer-scaled “particles”. The “particles” range in size from single molecules (DNA, proteins, etc.) to nanoparticles (quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, nano-scaled polystyrene latex beads, etc.) to biological organisms (bacteria, mammalian cells, etc.). This novel technique combines features of optical trapping (OT) and dielectrophoresis (DEP) in an innovative, dynamic way using a simple parallel plate electrode configuration. Transparent electrodes comprised of Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) on glass substrates apply an electric field to the fluid carrying the particles but also to allow light into and out of the fluid. Near-IR laser illumination causes subtle localized heating, creating an electric permittivity gradient that in turn drives a microscopic toroidal vortex. The vortex efficiently transports particles to a preferred location, usually the surface of the electrode.\r\n\r\nBiography: Professor Wereley completed his masters and doctoral research at Northwestern University.

According to the modified conceptual model, the TC IR is controlled by the intensification potential (IP) and the weakening rate due to surface friction under the eyewall. The IP is determined primarily by the potential energy available for a TC to develop, which is a function of the thermodynamics of the atmosphere and the underlying ocean, and the dynamical efficiency of the TC system, which depends strongly on the degree of convective organization in the eyewall and the inner-core inertial stability of the storm. At relatively low TC intensity, the IP of the storm is often larger than the weakening rate due to surface friction, leading to an increase in the TC IR with TC intensity. As the storm reaches an intermediate intensity of 35-40 m s-1, the difference between the IP and weakening rate due to surface friction reaches the maximum, corresponding with the maximum IR. Later on, the IR decreases as the TC further intensifies because surface friction increases with TC intensity at a faster rate than the IP. Finally, the storm approaches its maximum potential intensity (MPI) when IR becomes zero. The modified conceptual model is well validated with results from observations.","speaker":{"name":"王玉清","affiliation":" 夏威夷大学气象系"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:14:48Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93499ed5dbfb32993483","type":0,"title":"汽车系第173期学术沙龙-针对智能交通系统的电动助力转向系统开发","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学汽研所三层301会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-14T04:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-14T05:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"Brief Introduction to Prof. Shirou Nakano\r\n\r\nPosition:\r\nPresident of Japanese Society of Tribologists\r\nEducation:\r\n2000 Doctor of Informatics, KYOTO UNIV.\r\nWork Experience:\r\n2015-Present Seneior Fellow, JTEKT\r\n2015-Present Director, ITS JAPAN\r\n2012-2015 Member of the Board, Chief R&amp;D Officer\r\nProfessional Memberships:\r\n2016-Present President, Japanese Society of Tribologists\r\n2014-Present Guest Professor, TSINGHUA UNIV.

His work explores the sources, structure, dynamics and consequences of modern knowledge. Evans is particularly interested in the relation of markets to science and knowledge more broadly, and how evolutionary and generative models can inform our understanding of collective representations, experiences and certainty. He has studied how industry collaboration shapes the ethos, secrecy and organization of academic science; the web of individuals and institutions that produce innovations; and markets for ideas and their creators. Evans has also examined the impact of the Internet on knowledge in society. His work uses natural language processing, the analysis of social and semantic networks, statistical modeling, and field-based observation and interviews. Evans’ research is funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Mellon and Templeton Foundations and has been published in Science, PNAS, American Journal of Sociology, American Sociological Review, Social Studies of Science, Administrative Science Quarterly and other journals. His work has been featured in Nature, the Economist, Atlantic Monthly, Wired, NPR, BBC, El Pais, CNN and many other outlets.\r\nI explore how modeling the scientific process can create opportunities for improving it. I begin by demonstrating how the complex network of modern biomedical science provides a substrate on which a scientist–-and indeed science as a whole-–thinks, and its consequences for ongoing scientific discovery and human health. Using millions of scientific articles from MEDLINE, I show how science moves conservatively from problems posed and questions answered in one year to those examined in the next. Along the way, I show how contemporary science “changes its mind”; how it has become more risk-averse and less efficient at discovery; how the atmosphere of its own internal puzzles have largely decoupled it from health needs. We use this as an opportunity to demonstrate how much more efficient strategies can be found for mature fields, which involve greater individual risk-taking than the structure of modern scientific careers supports, and propose institutional alternatives that maximize a range of valuable objectives, from scientific discovery to robust understanding to technological advance.","speaker":{"name":"James Evans","affiliation":" Professor of Sociology, University of Chicago"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:14:57Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93529ed5dbfb3299348a","type":0,"title":"清华环境学术沙龙第293期：Electro-Fenton Technology: New Developments and Applications","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学环境节能楼209会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-12T05:30:00Z","to":"2016-06-12T06:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"院学术委员会主办","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"环境学术沙龙第293期\r\n\r\n报告题目：Electro-Fenton Technology: New Developments and Applications\r\n报告人：Mehmet Oturan 教授\r\nFull Professor of Exceptional Class at Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée.\r\n主要从事电化学水处理技术研究，是电芬顿技术的发明人之一，在Chemical Review，ES&amp;T，Water Research等刊物上发表论文190余篇，H指数48。担任Environmental Chemistry letters等期刊主编或副主编。2015年ACS年会为表彰Oturan教授在电化学水处理领域的杰出贡献，为其举办了专门分会。 \r\n 时间：2016年6月12日下午 1:30-2:30\r\n 地点：环境节能楼209会议室\r\n 院学术委员会主办","speaker":{"name":"Mehmet Oturan","affiliation":" 教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:14:58Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93549ed5dbfb3299348b","type":0,"title":"清华环境学术沙龙第294期：The GLIMPSE project: Exploring strategies for meeting energy, environmental and climate objectives","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学环境节能楼311会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-12T01:30:00Z","to":"2016-06-12T02:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"院学术委员会主办","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"环境学术沙龙第294期\r\n\r\n报告题目：The GLIMPSE project: Exploring strategies for meeting energy, environmental and climate objectives\r\n报告人：Dan Loughlin \r\n美国国家环保署 研究与发展办公室 科学家\r\n研究方向: 基于计算模拟、经济分析及应用的环境系统分析，包括未来污染物排放及水资源需求；新型能源技术的环境影响；低碳能源路径与环境的共同效益；能源、环境与气候联合目标的优化政策。发表同行评议文章20余篇，撰写了美国国家环保署全球变化与空气质量评估报告。 \r\n 时间：2016年6月12日上午 9:30-10:30\r\n 地点：环境节能楼311会议室\r\n院学术委员会主办","speaker":{"name":"Dan Loughlin","affiliation":""},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:15:00Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93569ed5dbfb3299348c","type":0,"title":"第五次清华大学-匹兹堡大学学术研讨会报名邀请","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学医学科学楼B323"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-10T00:30:00Z","to":"2016-06-10T01:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学医学院","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"第五次清华大学-匹兹堡大学学术研讨会（Fifth Annual University of Pittsburgh-Tsinghua University Joint Symposium, Modeling in Biomedical Research）于2016年6月10日至11日在清华大学医学科学楼B323举行，欢迎各位同学报名参会。\r\n会议免费报名：\r\n1. 请报名到以下邮箱：sunxuan@tsinghua.edu.cn；\r\n2. 邮件主题请标为“学院+学号+姓名+邮箱”，请勿重复报名；\r\n3. 报名截止日期2016年6月7日。\r\n诚挚邀请您的到来！\r\n\r\n","speaker":{"name":"医学院","affiliation":""},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:15:02Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93579ed5dbfb3299348d","type":0,"title":"化学学堂班系列讲座-Interfacing Surface Chemistry with Cell Biology: Rewiring Cell Surfaces for Controlling Cell Behavior and Applications in Tissue Engineering","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学老馆301会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-08T11:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-08T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"speaker":{"name":"Muhammad N.

However, it was already apparent that there were phenomena in nature that were not explained by the SM and that additional physics \"beyond the Standard Model (BSM)\" was needed. There is reason to believe that some of the BSM physics will be accessible with more data at the LHC. After describing the LHC and the CMS detector, I will discuss recent results from CMS on the search for physics beyond the SM; prospects for the data-taking period that is just starting and will last for about two more years; CERN's plan to increase the LHC luminosity (collision rate) far beyond its initial design; and the CMS collaboration's plans to upgrade the detector to handle the higher rates.\r\n\r\n报告人简介：Dr. Butler is the spokesperson of CMS experiment at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of CERN.

By using nonequilibrium Green's function method, we derive time-averaged formulism for spin transfer torques in a noncollinear magnetic tunneling system under ac modulation within wide-band-limit approximation. Using these formulas, we further investigate ac spin transfer torques in a carbon-nanotube-based magnetic tunneling system. It shows that under ac modulation, the low-bias linear (quadratic) dependence of the in-plane (out-of-plane) torque on bias still holds, and the regular angular dependence on noncollinear angle is maintained. By introducing photon-assisted tunneling, the bias-induced components of the in-plane and out-of-plane torques can be enhanced by about 10 and 80 times, respectively. Further analysis shows that optimized enhancement can be achieved by using ac driving frequency w=e0/k, k=1,2,..., where e0 marks a remote dc transmission peak, and using ac amplitude D such that D/w maximizes a kth-order Bessel function of the first kind. Out findings suggest that ac modulation is a promising way for electrical manipulation of spin transfer torques, paving the road towards emerging nanoelectronic and spintronic devices utilizing spin transfer torques.\r\n个人简介：Dr. Chen works on theoretical Physics as a postdoctoral fellow in the department of Physics at McGill University, Canada.

Cloud computing is assumed when bees have antennas that can sense the hive signals, and we explain the challenges in estimation and control in order to successfully guide the robotic bees.\r\n2.Bernd Heidergott报告\r\n题目：Analysis of Markov Influence Networks\r\nSince the early paper by Paul Schweitzer on perturbation analysis published in 1968, perturbation analysis of Markov chains has attracted much attention in the literature. Unfortunately, known perturbation bounds are rather limited in their range of applicability. Specifically, the relative error of the known perturbation bounds fails to tend to zero as the size of the perturbation tends to zero. We will introuduce a new bound that overcomes this drawback. We illustrate our findings by means of a realistic application to a problem in queuing.","speaker":{"name":"Felisa Vázquez-Abad，Bernd Heidergott","affiliation":" Felisa Vázquez-Abad（纽约城市大学）  Bernd Heidergott(阿姆斯特丹自由大学)"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:15:28Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93719ed5dbfb32993499","type":0,"title":"计算机科学的新黄金时代","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学主楼接待厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-07T11:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-07T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"校学术委员会","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"姚期智先生学术活动报告会\r\n时间：2016年6月7日晚19:00\r\n地点：清华大学主楼接待厅\r\n报名网址：http://www.diaochapai.com/survey1730695\r\n请感兴趣的师生点击上方网址进行报名！\r\n\r\n题目：计算机科学的新黄金时代\r\n报告\r\n阿尔法机器围棋战胜了世界冠军; 量子电脑可望于五年内出现; 许多科学先驱都未能预见的惊人突破已在世界各地发生。计算机科学是否进入了一个崭新的黄金时代？科学家当如何把握此契机, 选择研究方向, 將中国计算机科学帶入世界最先进水平？在此演讲中，我们将探讨新黄金时代来临的深层原因，并分享一些跨学科新领域的研究经验，与各位共同讨论与探索。\r\n主讲人简介：\r\n姚期智（Andrew Chi-Chih Yao）教授， 祖籍湖北，1946年出生于上海。于2000年获得计算机科学界最高荣誉的图灵奖，亦是至今获得此奖项的唯一华人。\r\n姚期智教授1967年毕业于台湾大学，1972年获哈佛大学物理学博士，1975年获伊利诺伊大学计算机科学博士。他先后任教于美国麻省理工学院（1975-1976）、斯坦福大学（1976-1986）、加州大学伯克利分校（1981-1982）、普林斯顿大学（1986-2004）。1998年当选为美国国家科学院院士，2000年选为美国人文科学院院士。2004年当选为中国科学院外籍院士。2015年当选香港科学院创院院士。\r\n姚期智教授在计算机科学的发展上，作出许多创始性的巨大贡献，包括 (1)作为现代密码学基础的奠定者之一，开展了以计算复杂性为基础的现代密码科学；(2)创建通讯复杂性理论、和伪随机数生成算法理论；(3)为量子计算建立全新典范，创建量子通讯复杂性和量子安全通讯模式。\r\n从2004年至今，姚期智教授任职于北京清华大学，于2007年成立了清华大学理论计算机学研究中心，并于2010年12月创建了清华大学交叉信息研究院，以推动多元化的信息科学研究及教学，及发展量子计算。姚期智教授亦受聘于香港中文大学为博文讲座教授。\r\n除图灵奖以外，姚期智教授曾荣获多项国际殊荣。姚教授于1987年获美国工业与应用数学学会波利亚（Polya）奖，1996年获美国计算机学会及电机电子工程学会颁授克努思（Knuth)奖，2003年获财团法人潘文渊文教基金会颁授研究杰出奖。并于2004年获伊利诺伊大学工程学院特殊贡献校友奖。此外，姚期智教授亦获香港城市大学（2003）、香港科技大学（2004）、香港中文大学（2006）、加拿大滑铁泸大学（2009）、澳门大学（2012）、香港理工大学（2014）颁授荣誉博士学位。姚教授还荣膺“国家友谊奖”（2005）、“首都十大教育新闻人物” （2010）、“功勋外教奖”（2014）、“高等教育国家级教学成果一等奖”（2005、2014）等。","speaker":{"name":"姚期智","affiliation":" 教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:15:29Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93739ed5dbfb3299349a","type":0,"title":"一带一路与国际经贸规则重构","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学公共管理学院一层报告厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-07T11:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-07T12:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学公共管理学院","school":"清华大学","address":""},"speaker":{"name":"陈德铭","affiliation":" 海峡两岸关系协会会长、商务部原部长"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:15:31Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93769ed5dbfb3299349b","type":0,"title":"Safe Electrolytes for Li-ion Batteries","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学工程系工物馆332教室"},"time":{"from":"2016-06-07T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-06-07T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学工程系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"Li-ion batteries are the critical enabling technology for the electric vehicles (EV) and renewable wind and solar energy.

Lattice instabilities are deeply connected to atomic vibrations and impact functional properties in many materials, including ferroelectrics, thermoelectrics, phase-change materials, and superionic conductors.Neutron and X-ray scattering and optical spectroscopy measurements can map phonon dispersions throughout reciprocal space, providing a quantitative information on the mean-free-paths of heat-carrying vibration modes, and revealing dominant scattering mechanisms, including anharmonicity, electron-phonon coupling, and scattering by defects or nanostructures. Such microscopic information about the microscopic origins of thermal transport provides important insights to design more efficient thermoelectric materials, for example. In addition, first-principles simulations of the atomic dynamics enable the rationalization of extensive experimental datasets. In particular, ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations at finite-temperature allow us to capture striking effects of anharmonicity near lattice instabilities.In this presentation, I will present results from our recent investigations of phonon transport in several important thermoelectric materials (PbTe, SnTe, AgSbTe2, SnSe, Mo3Sb7, tetrahedrites) [1-6]. Further, phonons can provide a large contribution to the entropy of solid-solid phase-transitions, and I will discuss several cases where our investigations of anharmonic phonons lead to a better understanding of phase-stability, highlighting recent results on thermodynamics of the metal-insulator transition in VO2 [7] and in ferroelectric perovskites.

A capacitively coupled, bio-conformal sensing electronics with over 1,000 channels demonstrate the robustness of this encapsulation strategy. Together, these results form a realistic pathway towards bio compatible, bio conformal and bio stable electronic implants, with potential for broad utility, such as brain/heart activity mapping, brain-machine interface, and pharmaceutical screening.

Early conception of varied phases of matter as well as transitions among them, perhaps developed from e.g. burning wood and heating water. Those ancient pursuits continue into the modern quest for understanding the structure of matter under extreme conditions: what’s the phase of matter when heated to unprecedented temperature? The answer to this question relies upon our understanding of the strong nuclear force, which is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). First principle calculations of QCD predict that the normal nuclear matter, when heated to be hot enough, will change into a new phase of matter called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In fact, the QGP was an old phase of matter that occupied the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. Today, such primordial droplets of QGP can be re-created repeatedly and measured precisely in relativistic heavy ion collisions (often called the Little Bangs). Remarkable discoveries have been made at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that together reveal the QGP as a nearly perfect quantum liquid with superior opaqueness. We will discuss a number of novel properties of QGP. In particular we will highlight the recent progress on how certain unusual transport phenomena stemming from microscopic chiral anomaly, which is intrinsically quantum mechanical and could manifest themselves in the macroscopic QGP fluid. A brief survey will be given on the theoretical developments, the experimental search in heavy ion collisions, as well as the recent exciting progress of such physics in Dirac and Weyl semimetals.\r\n个人简介：Prof. Jinfeng Liao is a theoretical nuclear physicist exploring the forms of matter under extreme conditions: extremely hot, extremely dense, and extremely strongly interacting.

It was introduced by Graham et al.. and it is known to exhibit superballistic growth of energy. I Numerically find that this phenomenon is independent of the presence of a kicking potential and is purely due to nonlinearity. Using Strichartz estimates I extablish rigorous quasi-exponential stability bounds. The rate of exponential growth of energy is just one Lyapunov exponent. Numerical analysis shows that orbits with a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent exist at any (positive) nonlinearity. For stationary orbits, the full spectrum of such exponents is analytically computable. The case when the kicking period is commensurate to 2\\pi yields a perfectly well defined classical dynamical system , i.e. a measure preserving transformation on the unit sphere in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, that undergoes a transition from integrability to ergodicity as the nonlinearity is increased.

The semiclassical approximation where 1/N plays the role of Planck&#700;s constant was used and for large N it is superior to standard quantum perturbation theory. The occupation difference was calculated also for the case where initially both sites are occupied provided that the difference in occupation is sufficiently large.

Sullivan is the University of Virginia’s eighth president. Since taking office in 2010, she has led UVA through a period of significant progress. In fall 2012, she launched a planning effort to provide a road-map for the University’s future. This effort produced a new strategic plan for the University, the Cornerstone Plan. Early successes from the new plan include an endowed Data Science Institute, a major in Global Studies, and a minor in Entrepreneurship. The University has overhauled its academic advising, and piloted the Meriwether Lewis Institute for Citizen Leadership. Under President Sullivan’s leadership, the University has developed a new financial model to ensure stability and transparency, launched a substantial program in Organizational Excellence, and created a program to expand the full-time faculty in multidisciplinary clusters.\r\n\r\nWorking with her highly effective leadership team, President Sullivan has prepared UVA to tackle the serious challenges in higher education related to cost-containment, affordability, student-debt reduction, faculty compensation, and the emergence of online education. UVA now has ongoing efforts, at both the unit and pan-University levels, to reduce costs, improve processes, and enhance efficiency, while protecting the quality of the academic enterprise. In 2013, President Sullivan proposed an aggressive plan to improve faculty compensation after many years of stagnation in faculty salaries. Under her leadership, faculty and staff have been encouraged to experiment strategically with new technologies. UVA’s Advanced Research Institute has extended the University’s research capacity to include new partners. The renovated and energized Licensing and Ventures Group assists faculty, staff, and students in protecting and enhancing their intellectual property. \r\n\r\nIn spring 2013, President Sullivan led the University to completion of its $3-billion capital campaign, and quickly announced plans to raise financial support for three strategic priorities: retaining and recruiting top faculty, restoring the University’s Jeffersonian Grounds, and providing needy students with scholarships.\r\n\r\nPresident Sullivan is a respected scholar in labor force demography. The author or coauthor of six books and many scholarly articles, her most recent research has focused on measuring productivity in higher education.\r\n\r\n弗吉尼亚大学背景与历史简介\r\n弗吉尼亚大学是一所杰出的公立大学。该校始建于1819年，由美国建国领袖之一、第三任总统托马斯·杰斐逊创立。曾有三位美国总统成为该校董事——杰斐逊、麦迪逊、门罗。弗大的校园由杰斐逊亲自规划设计，促进了跨学科之间以及学生与教师之间的密切互动。这个校园规划理念后成为全美高校的模板，也对全世界的校园设计——包括中国清华大学及其他学校——产生了深远影响。全球范围内仅有四所大学入选联合国教科文组织世界遗产名录，弗吉尼亚大学是美国唯一一所获此殊荣的学校。\r\n弗吉尼亚大学以其独特的住宿体验、全学生管理的荣誉制度、及其在美国历史与高等教育进程中的持续影响而闻名于世。两百年来，弗大发展成为一所顶级研究型高校，拥有丰富的人文艺术资源、享有盛名的职业与研究生教育以及不断增强的国际影响力。弗吉尼亚大学一直位列全美顶级公立学校行列。\r\n\r\n\r\n特别提醒：\r\n1、因场地所能容纳观众人数有限，请感兴趣的同学及时在线报名。如报名人数已满，系统将提前关闭。\r\n2、如果您想及时获知清华海外名师讲堂的最新信息，请关注清华大学信息门户“教务公告”及“学术活动”栏目。\r\n\r\n联系电话：62797498\r\n国际合作与交流处\r\n研究生院\r\n教务处\r\n\r\n\r\n附： 清华海外名师讲堂简介\r\n“清华海外名师讲堂”是汇集我校高端国际交流资源，面向广大同学开办的高层次、前沿性、成系列的海外人士演讲，设有“全球领导力”和“前沿科技”两大系列。演讲人汇集诺贝尔奖得主、著名学者、外国政要、知名大学校长、跨国企业高管等名家名人。为广大同学提供了拓展国际视野和学术视野，提升外语水平和交流能力的宝贵资源。\r\n“清华海外名师讲堂”面向全校学生开放，一般每年开设20-30讲，课程采用学生IC卡记录考勤，无需选课。凡在读期间累计听讲8次并递交总结报告者，可获得1个学分（相关事宜请联系62797498）。","speaker":{"name":"特蕾莎&#8226;苏利文","affiliation":" 弗吉尼亚大学校长"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:16:19Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93a49ed5dbfb329934bc","type":0,"title":"环境学术沙龙第287期：Ecological theory in engineering design: progress, problems and prospects","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学环境节能楼311会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-31T01:30:00Z","to":"2016-05-31T02:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"院学术委员会主办","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"环境学术沙龙第287期\r\n\r\n报告题目：Ecological theory in engineering design: progress, problems and prospects \r\n报告人：Thomas Curtis 教授\r\n重要学术兼职：EPSRC Dream Fellow （UK）\r\n研究方向: Biological Treatment Systems Experimental and Theoretical Microbial Ecology\r\n成果：在生物处理系统理论、实验与理论微生物生态学等方面取得了突出的研究成果。在Science，Nature Review Microbiology 等重要期刊上发表了具有重要影响的论文90余篇。 \r\n时间：2016年5月31日上午9:30-12:00\r\n地点：环境节能楼311会议室\r\n院学术委员会主办","speaker":{"name":"Thomas Curtis","affiliation":" 教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:16:20Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93a69ed5dbfb329934bd","type":0,"title":"Enabling high energy lithium ion batteries","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学化学工程系工物馆336教室"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-30T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-30T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"化学工程系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"Title: Enabling high energy lithium ion batteries Many anode materials, including hard carbon, tin, tin oxide, silicon, and silicon oxide, have high theoretical capacities (&gt;550 mAh/g) but tend to exhibit a large initial capacity loss (ICL). This is an important issue for the commercial application of some types of high capacity anodes in full LIBs that overrides the true reversible capacity of the anode itself. The existing strategies employed to address this issue usually involve adding different lithium sources to the anode, such as lithium powder or lithiated transition metal nitrides. Unfortunately, these strategies are not facile and may create safety issues in the practical application of LIBs. In this study, a new strategy is explored using a sacrificial lithium source additive, such as Li5FeO4, which in theory could release up to 5 lithium cations per mole to the cell upon first charge (equivalent to 867 mAh/g). As such, small amounts of LFO co-blended with the active cathode in conventional electrode laminate coatings could provide a solution to mitigate the ICL issues of anode with large ICL.Conductive additive, such as carbon black, is very minor component and it is often overlooked. However, with stagnant development of active materials, the reduction of carbon black can make big impact on the improvement of cell energy density. In our lab, we reduced the loading of novel carbon black (Cabot) from 5 wt.% to 1 wt.% in the cathode, which increased the energy density of the electrode by 9% without sacrificing the electrochemical performance. In this work, we noticed that there is nonlinear conductivity of electrodes, which is significantly affected by the dispersion and surface crystalline quality of carbon black nanoparticles.

A compelling case manifesting such subtlety is oxide heterostructures and heterointerfaces exhibiting fascinating emergent behaviors due to numerous combinative contributions of atomic structures and chemistries, which can be effectively harnessed for the design of advanced materials for information and energy applications and accelerating materials integration into advanced devices. Surface/interface X-ray scattering from modern synchrotron sources integrated with phase retrieval direct methods provides a very powerful toolkit to decipher the interfacial subtlety. This is essential to our ability to provide a quantitative and realistic description of the interfacial boundaries by which to engineer properties of oxide interfaces using atomic structure-driven design principles in a reliable and controlled manner. In this seminar, I will firstly give a brief introduction of how to obtain atomic mapping of oxide heterostructure and heterointerfaces with sub-&Aring;ngstrom resolution by phase retrieving coherent Bragg rods, wherein complete atomically structural information hidden, in particular on the COBRA method in combination with the difference map algorithm achieving unprecedented speed of convergence and precision. In the following, I will demonstrate a few recent studies in the exploration of oxide heterostructures and heterointerfaces for information and energy applications by applying the direct method, such as revealing structural motifs responsible for 2DEG and superconductivity adjacent with heterointerfaces, catching structural perturbations in response to varied polar energy landscapes, differentiating at the atomic-layer level the complicated cation distribution relevant with creating new polar order and enhancing oxygen reduction activities, and depth-resolved mapping oxygen-octahedral connectivity patterns essential with incipient functionalities of heterostructures. In the end, I will give a short commentary on future opportunities in X-ray studies of oxide interfaces and heterostructures enabled by the exciting advancements towards ultimate storage rings, in particular with enhanced high-energy and coherence capabilities. \r\n简历：周华博士在美国能源部阿贡国家实验室中的先进光子源大科学装置担任研究物理学家。从2011年9月开始他负责管理先进光子源中由可调制扭摆器构架的束线实验站。同时他还负责开发和拓展专门针对先进材料制备，功能测试和应用方向的原位，操作同步和实时X射线研究。科研课题特别集中在研究复杂环境中表面与界面现象和过程方面 （例如，外延纳米结构和异质结构的薄膜沉积，强关联凝聚态体系中的新兴物理现象，各种电化学能源存储和转化中的界面问题）。他在应用X射线相复原直接法表征和揭示外延薄膜的表面／界面结构变化与动力学方面极富经验。 加入先进光子源部之前他分别在美国能源部布鲁克海文国家实验室的国家同步辐射光子源部和阿贡国家实验室的化学科学与工程部从事博士后的研究工作。他与2007年年底在美国佛蒙特大学获得材料科学博士学位。他在薄膜／异质结构和表面／界面X射线技术方面发表了一系列书章，综述和60多篇同行评议的论文。很多相关论文发表在国际重要影响力和知名杂志上，包括Nature, Nature Physics, PNAS, Energy and Environmental Science, Advanced Materials, Advanced Functional Materials, Nano Letters, and ACS-Nano 等。他还在各种国际会议，大学和国家实验室做过20多次的邀请报告或专题讲座。 ","speaker":{"name":"Hua Zhou","affiliation":" Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Department of Energy, USA","bio":"周华博士在美国能源部阿贡国家实验室中的先进光子源大科学装置担任研究物理学家。从2011年9月开始他负责管理先进光子源中由可调制扭摆器构架的束线实验站。同时他还负责开发和拓展专门针对先进材料制备，功能测试和应用方向的原位，操作同步和实时X射线研究。科研课题特别集中在研究复杂环境中表面与界面现象和过程方面 （例如，外延纳米结构和异质结构的薄膜沉积，强关联凝聚态体系中的新兴物理现象，各种电化学能源存储和转化中的界面问题）。他在应用X射线相复原直接法表征和揭示外延薄膜的表面／界面结构变化与动力学方面极富经验。 加入先进光子源部之前他分别在美国能源部布鲁克海文国家实验室的国家同步辐射光子源部和阿贡国家实验室的化学科学与工程部从事博士后的研究工作。他与2007年年底在美国佛蒙特大学获得材料科学博士学位。他在薄膜／异质结构和表面／界面X射线技术方面发表了一系列书章，综述和60多篇同行评议的论文。很多相关论文发表在国际重要影响力和知名杂志上，包括Nature, Nature Physics, PNAS, Energy and Environmental Science, Advanced Materials, Advanced Functional Materials, Nano Letters, and ACS-Nano 等。他还在各种国际会议，大学和国家实验室做过20多次的邀请报告或专题讲座。","position":"博士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:16:25Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93aa9ed5dbfb329934c0","type":0,"title":"TNC经济社会讲座:“互联网+”下的创业新生态","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学甲所第三会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-30T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学&#8226;野村综研中国研究中心","school":"清华大学","address":""},"speaker":{"name":"叶勤康","affiliation":" 36氪副总裁"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:16:26Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93ac9ed5dbfb329934c1","type":0,"title":"美国专利挖掘、申请和管理的报告","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学东门外华业大厦1201会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-30T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"成果与知识产权管理办公室","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"成果与知产办系列讲座：为进一步提高学校师生知识产权保护和运用的能力，提高知识产权质量，推动科技成果转移转化工作，成果与知产办邀请专家举行系列讲座，欢迎广大师生积极参加！\r\n讲座提纲：Mining Obtaining and Managing Patents in the U S and Abroad_05 26 16.ppt","speaker":{"name":"Michael D.

Many existing work focuses on the averaging estimator. We propose a one-step approach to enhance a simple-averaging based distributed estimator. We derive the corresponding asymptotic properties of the newly proposed estimator. We find that the proposed one-step estimator enjoys the same asymptotic properties as the centralized estimator. The proposed one-step approach merely requires one additional round of communication in relative to the averaging estimator; so the extra communication burden is insignificant. In finite sample cases, numerical examples show that the proposed estimator outperforms the simple averaging estimator with a large margin in terms of the mean squared errors. A potential application of the one-step approach is that one can use multiple machines to speed up large scale statistical inference with little compromise in the quality of estimators. The proposed method becomes more valuable when data can only be available at distributed machines with limited communication bandwidth. This talk is based on joint work with Cheng Huang.

In this talk we show that the phases of many-body interacting multi-component quantum liquids in one dimension can be described by WRs based on the compressibility, susceptibility and specific heat associated with each component. These WRs arise due to surprisingly simple additivity rules within subsystems reminiscent of the rules for multi-resistor networks in series and parallel. Using experimentally realized multi-species cold atomic gases as examples, we prove that the Wilson ratios uniquely identify phases of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, while providing universal scaling relations at the boundaries between phases. Since these WRs are composed of direct measurable thermodynamic quantities, our findings provide an easy way to map out quantum phases experimentally. 个人简介：林海青, 教授。1981年中国科学技术大学学士。1983年美国Iowa州立大学，理学硕士。1987年美国加州大学San Diego分校物理系，物理学博士。博士毕业后美国Brookhaven 国家实验室副研究员（Research Associate）, 1987-1989;

Fish moving downstream that pass through hydropower turbines can be injured or killed, and the inability of fish to pass upstream of hydropower projects prohibits them from reaching spawning grounds. Hydropower licenses issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may include requirements for owners/operators to implement fish passage technologies or other measures to protect, enhance, or mitigate damages to fish and wildlife, as identified by the federal resource agencies. Although FERC is directed to balance developmental and nondevelopmental values in licensing decisions, many contend that balancing has been inadequate. Thus, fish passage and protection has become a major controversy between the hydropower industry and resource agencies.\r\nThis report describes technologies for fish passage, and those for protection against turbine entrainment and mortality, with an emphasis on FERC-licensed hydropower projects. OTA identifies three areas for policy improvements. First, to establish and maintain sustainable fisheries, goals for protection and restoration of fish resources need to be clarified and strengthened through policy shifts and additional research. Secondly, increased coordination is needed among fishway design engineers, fisheries biologists, and hydropower operators, especially during the design and construction phases of fish passage and protection technologies, to improve efficiency. Finally, new initiatives with strong science and evaluation components are needed to advance fish passage technologies, especially for safe downstream passage.","speaker":{"name":"邓志群","affiliation":" 美国西北太平洋国家实验室","bio":"Dr. Zhiqun Deng（邓志群博士），美国西北太平洋国家实验室水文地理学能源与环境方向首席科学家。本科与硕士毕业于天津大学，博士毕业于University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign。","position":"博士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:16:47Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de93c09ed5dbfb329934d2","type":0,"title":"Baryon Acoustic Oscillations with cosmic voids","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学蒙民伟科技南楼S727"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-26T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"物理系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"We present a novel parameter-free cosmological void finder (DIVE, Delaunay TrIangulation Void findEr) based on Delaunay Triangulation (DT), which efficiently computes the empty spheres constrained by a discrete set of tracers.

Creating a surface disturbs the balance between these degrees of freedom, and in many cases results in phased Hidden in the bulk. Several examples will be presented to illustrate this phenomenon. 1) Dynamic antiphase spin domain walls have been proposed for the parent compound of the Fe based super-conductor BaFe2As2. The surface (√2x√2) R45o phase displays a coupled structural-magnetic antiphase domain walls with a reduced symmetry compared to the bulk. 2) The (1x2) surface phaseCa(Fe1-xCox)2 stabilizes Antiferromagnetic Ordering leading to the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetic ordering. 3) The final example is for Mn doped double-layer Ruthenate Sr3(Ru1-xMnx)2O7, where the surface phase diagram is almost opposite from the bulk due to surface induced tilt of the octahedral in the parent compound. The surface of Sr3(Ru0.84Mn0.16)2O7 is metallic while the bulk is insulating, because the surface tilt has been removed.\r\nBio:Professor Plummer is a world-renowned scholar in surfaces, with a BA in Math and Physics from Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon, and a Ph.

They are excellent conductors of heat and electricity, damage and thermal shock tolerant and fracture toughness values as high as 15 MPa√m. Some are lightweight, stiff and have good creep and outstanding oxidation resistance. More recently we have shown that by simply immersing MAX phase powders,at room temperature,in HFthe A-layers are selectively etched to produce 2D materials that we labeled MXenes to emphasize the loss of the A-group element and theirsimilaritiesto graphene.Unlike hydrophobic graphene, MXenes are hydrophilicand behave as“conductive clays”, a hitherto unknown combination. MXenes such as Ti2C, V2C, Nb2C and Ti3C2can be used as electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SC) as well as transparent conductive electrodes, with performances that are quite impressive. In all cases, when used as anodes in LIB, MXenes showed an excellent capability to handle high cycling rates. Flexible, additives-free electrodes of delaminated Ti3C2 showed reversible capacities of &gt;400mAhg-1 at 1C and 110mAhg-1 at 36 C, the latter for &gt; 700 cycles.SC'swith volumetric capacitances of &gt; 900 F/cm3 were obtained.The potential of using MXenes in energy storage, as transparent conductive electrodes, among many other applications will be highlighted. \r\nShort Biography Prof. Michel W.

These effects can be diverse and can seriously impact the design performance at all hierarchical levels including integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, multi-chip modules and backplanes. If not considered during the design stage, signal integrity effects can cause failed designs. Since extra iterations in the design cycle are costly, accurate prediction of these effects is a necessity in high-speed designs. Consequently, preserving signal integrity has become one of the most challenging tasks facing designers of modern multifunction and miniature electronic circuits and systems. This talk provides a comprehensive approach for understanding the multidisciplinary problem of signal integrity: issues/modeling/analysis in high-speed designs.\r\n报告人简介：Ramachandra Achar (S’95-M’00-SM’04-FM’13) received the B.

As compared to obtaining a tissue biopsy which is invasive and painful, ‘‘liquid biopsy’’ for CTCs detection can be easily performed via a routine blood draw. The presence and number of CTCs in peripheral blood has been associated with the severity of the disease and have potential use for early detection, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment monitoring purposes. The isolation of CTCs using microfluidics is attractive as the flow conditions can be accurately manipulated to achieve an efficient separation. Here, we demonstrate several effective separation methods by utilizing the unique differences in the mechanical properties such as size and deformability of cancer cells from that of blood cells. By exploiting the fluid dynamics in specially designed microfluidic channels, CTCs which are generally stiffer and larger can be physically separated from the more deformable blood constituents. Using this label-free approach, we are able to retrieve viable CTCs that are not only suitable for downstream molecular analysis such as genetic or RNA sequencing, but also for expansion and culture. With blood specimens from cancer patients, we confirmed successful detection, isolation and retrieval of CTCs. Identification of CTCs via their mechanical signatures will not only aid in the determination of malignancy and disease, but also enable personalized treatment by the possible detection of any actionable mutation unique to individual patient. \r\n\r\nBiographyProfessor Lim is a Provost’s Chair Professor at the Department of Biomedical Engineering as well as a Principal Investigator at the Mechanobiology Institute at the National University of Singapore.

One of the challenges is the inherently multi-scale nature of the problem: the macro-scale impacts of aerosol particles are governed by processes that occur on the particle-scale, and these microscale processes are difficult to represent in large-scale models. An important quantity in this context is the so-called aerosol mixing state, which we define as the distribution of the aerosol chemical species over the population. It is not clear to what extent mixing state information needs to be represented in atmospheric aerosol models in order to capture aerosol impacts on climate. Progress on this question has been hampered by our lack of suitable metrics for aerosol mixing state, and suitable models that are able to resolve and simulate mixing state.\r\n In this seminar I will present a framework to quantify the aerosol mixing state impacts on climate. This includes a metric for aerosol mixing state, which is based on diversity measures derived from the information-theoretic entropy of the chemical species distribution among particles.

In the second part of the talk, I will present our work on high-resolution Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). MRSI has been recognized as a powerful tool for noninvasive metabolic studies, but clinical and research applications of this technology have been developing more slowly than was expected. One reason for this situation is the problems of long data acquisition time, poor spatial resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that have limited the use of the existing spectroscopic imaging techniques for in vivo applications. In this talk, I will present a subspace-based approach, called SPectroscopic Imaging by exploiting spatiospectral CorrElation (SPICE), to high-resolution MRSI. SPICE exploits the partial separability (PS) property of spectroscopic signals and adopts special data acquisition and reconstruction schemes enabled by the PS model to recover high-resolution, high-SNR, MRSI images from sparsely sampled data. I will show our most recent results of high-resolution 1H and 31P-MRSI obtained to demonstrate the capability of SPICE.\r\n报告人简介：Chao Ma received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and his Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign (UIUC), USA, in 2013.

The descriptions (called mesoscopic dynamical theories) form a family called a multiscale dynamics. For example, classical equilibrium thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, kinetic theory, and particle mechanics represent multiscale dynamics composed of four different mesoscopic dynamical theories formulated on four different levels of description. The mesoscopic dynamical theories are autonomous, they differ in the amount of details that their take into account (they belong to different levels of description) and in the domain of their validity. My objective is to formulate multiscale dynamics that includes a unified mathematical formulation of individual mesoscopic dynamical theories and a unified formulation of relations among them. \r\nLecture 1 Mesoscopic dynamics is a combination of Hamiltonian dynamics (inherited from mechanics of &#8764; 1023 particles composing the macroscopic systems) and gradient dynamics (arising due to the neglect of certain details). In the first lecture I will present Hamiltonian dynamics as it arises in particle mechanics, continuum (and generalized continuum) mechanics, and kinetic theories. \r\nLecture 2 How do ignored details influence the time evolution of important features of the behavior of macroscopic systems? What features can we afford to ignore and what we have to keep? It is thermodynamics (i.e. the nonmechanical concept of entropy and the Maximum Entropy Principle) that address these questions. In this second lecture I will formulate (static) multiscale thermodynamics in the unifying setting of contact geometry (i.e. geometry in which Legendre transformations are the natural transformations). \r\nLecture 3 It is the mesoscopic time evolution (combining the Hamiltonian and the gradient dynamics) that maximizes the entropy. The multiscale dynamics finds its 1 natural formulation in the setting of contact geometry. The unified formulation is in fact a (dynamic, nonequilibrium) multiscale thermodynamics (applicable on all levels of description and also for externally driven macroscopic systems). \r\nLecture 4 In the fourth lecture I will present some specific applications (in addition to specific illustrations presented in all three previous lectures). The choice of the applications will depend on the particular interests of the participants of the seminar. I suggest: rheology of complex fluids (polymeric fluids, colloids, and immiscible blends), kinetic theories and their relation to hydrodynamic and extended hydrodynamic theories, Cattaneo-type heat conduction. \r\nIntroduction of the Speaker \r\nMiroslav Grmela is a theoretical physicist working in the domain of multiscale thermodynamics (equilibrium, nonequilibrium, and statistical) and in continuum mechanics and kinetic theory of complex fluids.

Because of their chemical inertness, the transformation of the hydrocarbons to value-added products requires the activation of thermodynamically stable C-H and C-C bonds. Metal-mediated bond activation circumvents this problem by stimulating inert hydrocarbons to react with other molecules. Metal-Hydrocarbon radicals formed in the entrance channel and subsequent steps are transient and reactive and play essential roles in such activation reactions. In our work, metal-hydrocarbon reactions are carried out in a pulsed supersonic molecular beam source; reaction intermediates and products are identified by time-of-flight mass spectrometry and investigated by pulsed-field-ionization zero-electron-kinetic-energy, mass-analyzed threshold ionization, IR-UV photoionization, and electron velocity-map imaging spectroscopies. In this talk, we will discuss metal-hydrocarbon radicals formed by metal adsorption on aromatic surfaces and by metal-mediated dehydrogenation, C-C bond breakage and coupling, and cyclo-oligomerization of small alkenes and alkynes. The discussion will include the bonding and structures, electronic states and energies, and formation mechanisms of the radicals.

A typical power system in countries such as United States has large-scale central power stations located in remote areas, which are connected to transmission system. Recent tendency is, however, toward developing small-scale distributed generating units; thus power generating units will be located near consumers and large generating units will be replaced by a number of smaller generating units. The prospect of reduced cost, increased reliability, increased energy efficiency, improved power quality, and energy independence are the main motivation for customers to increase their interests to what is called “smart grid.” Renewable energy sources including photovoltaic and wind turbines and fuel cells are categorized as main energy sources of DG in future smart grids with promising sustainability.\r\nThere are clear evidences suggesting that renewable energy-distributed generation (RE-DG) is growing worldwide and governments around the world considering ambitious targets of incorporating considerable amounts of RE-DG in response to the need to enhance fuel diversity, increasing security of energy supply and economic sustainability. There are many factors driving usage of RE-DG. The RE-DG using solar energy and wind power offers more environmental, social, and in some cases economic benefits. The use of solar energy and wind power has increased so fast in the past two decades that these two technologies are considered as success story. \r\nThis talk will be focused on the progress of i) solar energy, ii) wind energy and iii) integration and Power Electronics Interface. \r\n\r\n报告人简介：\r\nDr. Lee received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from North Dakota University, Fargo, ND, and the Ph.D. degree in Systems Science from Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI.

Considering that energy use in buildings represents more than 40% of global energy consumption and that humans spend 90% of the time indoors, technologies enabling smarter buildings can lead to significant reductions in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and produce a comfortable, efficient and sustainable environment. The above can be achieved through smart building design, advanced automation, and intelligent computing/communication technologies to efficiently design, operate, monitor, and maintain buildings. In particular, integrated building energy management will be highlighted in the talk. The goal is to demonstrate that smart buildings are a fertile problem context for research and development. We will then briefly indicate how the same modeling and optimization framework can be extended to tackle another important issue of grid integration of intermittent renewable generation (e.g., using wind and solar), and how Industry 4.0 can serve as enabling technologies for intelligent automation. We will have time for questions and answers on technical questions and beyond. \r\n\r\n演讲人简历: Peter B.

This finding marks the beginning of gravitational-wave astronomy. From now on, we are able to probe our universe using both long-range forces in nature. In the foreseeable future, the gravitational wave astronomy will be exponentially growing, with more detectors targeting gravitational waves at different frequencies and more events detected every week. This will provide us great opportunities but also impose challenges as well. In the first part of my talk, I will discuss the physics of gravitational wave detectors, emphasizing its basic principles and dominant noise sources, as well as ongoing efforts to improve detector sensitivity to fulfill the growing need. In the second half of my talk, I will discuss the astrophysics of gravitational-wave sources - especially compact sources such as black holes and neutron stars. I shall explain the spacetime dynamics, gravitational-wave emission during compact binary mergers and possible electromagnetic radiation from these compact objects. In the next few years with new gravitational-wave observations and possible electromagnetic counterpart measurements, we may dramatically improve our understandings on the astrophysics of these sources. \r\n\r\n\r\nBio: Dr. Huan Yang studied in Tsinghua University from 2002 to 2004 and transferred to Caltech afterwards.

I have broad research interests in both organic and inorganic chemistry to create new materials for solar cells, photodetectors,light emitting diodes, etc.In this talk, our rational design of low-bandgap conjugated polymers for organic photovoltaic will be discussed in the first half. By developing new organic building blocks, fine-tuning the molecular weight, solid-state packing and nano-scale thin film morphology, polymers with small optical bandgap, high charge carrier mobility, and high photovoltaic performance (with two record efficiencies) are obtained. However, the fundamental limitation of low charge carrier mobility in organic semi-conductors is still there, probably due to the amorphous or semi-crystalline nature. To break the limitation, new materials with more ordered structure (higher degree of crystallinity) might be required. The other half of the presentation will be focusing on the fundamental chemistry of crystalline polymers and inorganic perovskite nanostructures for the next generation solution-processed electronics.","speaker":{"name":"窦乐添","affiliation":" 博士 加州大学伯克利分校"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:18:23Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94219ed5dbfb32993511","type":0,"title":"Optoelectronics of Graphene-based Van der Waals Heterostructures","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学理科楼三楼报告厅C302"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-13T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-13T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&物理系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"The photoresponse of materials is governed by energy relaxation pathways of photo-excited electron-hole pairs. In graphene, due to frequent electron-electron collision and weak electron-lattice coupling, a novel transport regime is reached in which the photo-generated carrier population can remain hot while the lattice stays cool. In this talk, I will show that light is converted to electrical currents through a hot-carrier assisted thermoelectric effect in intrinsic graphene[1]. The thermal energy slowly leaks to the lattice via two distinct processes of electron-phonon coupling that can be tuned by temperature and charge density[2]. We also implemented a scheme to control the initial stage of photo-excited carriers before they collide with ambient carriers (less than ten femtoseconds) to form a hot Fermi-Dirac distribution, which is realized in a graphene-boron nitride-graphene heterostructure[3].\r\n   The weak electron-phonon coupling and frequent electron-electron scattering revealed above strongly alter the nature of particle and energy transport, leading to a collision dominant fluid behavior for electrons. In the last part of the talk, I will discuss our observation of highly-ordered photocurrent patterns at the charge neutral point of graphene, which is likely related to the ballistic thermal transport of hot electron-hole plasma in the hydrodynamic regime[4].\r\n\r\n[1] N.

Strategic Information Transmission \r\n Strategic information transmission refers to a variation (and a substantial one) of the standard paradigm of information transmission in communication (design of an encoder and a decoder in unison to minimize some distortion measure), where now the encoder and the decoder have (intentionally) misaligned objectives. This leads to a non-cooperative game with a dynamic (non- classical) information structure, where one can adopt as a solution concept either the Nash or the Stackelberg equilibrium. The talk will introduce this class of problems, which have been of interest to multiple communities, including economics, information theory, communication, signal processing, and control, since the early 1980s, having picked up considerable steam very recently. As an overview of the topic, both old and new results will be presented, with one of the highlights (and perhaps a surprising element) being that there appears to be a major difference between the structures of the encoders and the decoders under Nash and Stackelberg equilibria, even when the channel is Gaussian and the (misaligned) distortion measures are quadratic. Several applications within the broader contexts of cyber-physical systems and decentralized stochastic control will conclude the presentation. \r\n\r\nTamer Bas&#807;ar has been with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since 1981, where he holds the academic positions of Swanlund Endowed Chair; Center for Advanced Study Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering; Professor, Coordinated Science Laboratory; Professor, Information Trust Institute; and Affiliate Professor, Mechanical Sciences and Engineering. He is also the Director of the Center for Advanced Study. He is a member of the US National Academy of Engineering and the European Academy of Sciences; Fellow of IEEE, IFAC, and SIAM; a past president of the IEEE Control Systems Society (CSS), the founding president of the International Society of Dynamic Games (ISDG), and a past president of the American Automatic Control Council (AACC). He has received several awards and recognitions over the years, including the highest awards of IEEE CSS, IFAC, AACC, and ISDG, the IEEE Control Systems Technical Field Award, and a number of international honorary doctorates and professorships. Dr. Bas&#807;ar has over 700 publications in systems, control, communications, optimization, and dynamic games, including books on non-cooperative dynamic game theory, robust control, network security, wireless and communication networks, and stochastic networks. He is editor of several book series. \r\n\r\n2. Social Networks Analysis: Consensus or Disagreement?\r\n The recent years have shown substantial activities towards the analysis of dynamic social networks, which were opened up by rapid progresses in complex systems and networks. A closer examination of these systems has revealed some common principles regarding coordination and self-organization, including consensus protocols for distributed decision making. This discovery attracted the attention of many research communities to models of social groups evolution, which often exhibit rich and non-trivial dynamics, and sometime show persistent disagreement or other irregular behaviors.\r\n\r\nThe number of dynamic models which describe social group dynamics is currently growing. Their properties are not yet deeply investigated from the systems and control-theoretic viewpoint. In particular, some basic questions concerning identification, stability, convergence and resilience still remain unsolved. Furthermore, the usefulness of these models to describe the behavior of large groups in real social networks is still a widely open issue. This talk will address these questions, and also provide connections between dynamic models of social networks and centrality measures in complex networks.\r\n\r\nRoberto Tempo is currently a Director of Research of Systems and Computer Engineering at the institute IEIIT, National Research Council (CNR), Politecnico di Torino, Italy. His research activities are mainly focused on the analysis and design of complex systems with uncertainty, and various related applications within information technology, which include the PageRank computation in the Google search engine,opinion dynamics in social networks and distributed localization of wireless sensor networks.

First, some special problems in synchronization of complex networks are presented. Disconnected synchronized regions and interesting changes of H2 norm of complex networks are discussed in detail. Disconnected synchronized regions show the possibility of intermittent synchronization and that sometimes the eigenratio cannot be a sychronizability index. Second, consensus of multi-agent systems is discussed. The consensus region can be proposed by borrowing the idea of synchronization of complex networks. Finite-time consensus of a class of second order multi-agent systems and event-triggered control problems are further presented. Finally, some relationships between synchronization of complex networks and consensus of multi-agent systems are discussed. \r\n\r\nZhisheng Duan received the B. S. and M.

Controlling the Internet of Things - from Energy Saving to Fast Evacuation in Smart Buildings \r\n There is an increasing interest in connecting things into network (known as the Internet of Things) to improve the performance and to provide novel services. Control has a big role here not just to help connecting things together, but also to make things “smarter”. In this talk, we will focus on a particular type of Internet of Things, namely the smart buildings. There is an increasing demand on energy efficiency, comfort, and safety in buildings. It is possible to achieve these different and sometimes conflicting objectives in the same time. Occupant-oriented wireless sensor network plays a key role, which collects information on the demand (what the occupant wants), the supply (what the building can offer), and how the two parts may coordinate with each other (the elasticity of the demand and the supply). We will briefly review the state of the art and the state of practice in this field. In particular, we will see how to control this Internet of Things to achieve energy saving and fast evacuation in smart buildings. \r\n\r\n(Samuel) Qing-Shan Jia received the B.E. degree in automation in July 2002 and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering in July 2006, both from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

Minimum feedback information for networked control and estimation\r\n Networked control systems, which arise in several important applications including remote robot control, automated navigation and sensor networks, have opened up huge opportunities to bring together ideas from both control/estimation and information theories to design engineering systems. By adapting ideas for quantifying network uncertainties from information theory, this talk studies the fundamental bottlenecks of feedback network on linear systems. Specifically, we explicitly delineate the minimum bit-rate for stabilizability, the maximum packet dropout rate for observability, and the network topology for synchronizability, all of which provide the possibility and impossibility of designing networked control systems. \r\n\r\nKeyou You received the B.S. degree in Statistical Science from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2012.

About 3 times the mass of the sun was converted intogravitationalwaveenergyin a fraction of a second.

In the structure, in-plane current generates spin accumulation at the NM/FM interfaces via spin Hall effect and/or interfacial spin-orbit coupling, which gives rise to a torque to the FM layer. In this talk, we present the materials engineering which enhances the SOT switching efficiency in Pt/FM oxide structures. The first one is to control the resistivity of the Pt with varying the sputtering condition, which increases the spin Hall effect. The second is to engineer the NM/FM interface by introducing the thin Ti layers to modulate the interfacial spin-orbit coupling contribution. Moreover, we will also present a field-free SOT switching, which is achieved by replacing the NM layer with antiferromagnet IrMn, generating SOT as well as exchange bias effective in-plane magnetic field. \r\nBioDr Byong-Guk Park received his B.

We have also applied engineered culture of cell populations on three-dimensional scaffolds toward the development of biologically active hybrid scaffold/extracellular matrix constructs for regenerative medicine applications as well as testing of anticancer drugs.

This is a deep high-dimensional generalization of the study of closed geodesics. The setting is very general, being that of Geometric Measure Theory, and the main application until very recently was the construction of minimal varieties of any dimension in a compact Riemannian manifold. \r\n\r\nIn the past few years we have discovered new applications of this old theory, including a proof of the Willmore conjecture, of the Freedman-He-Wang conjecture, and of Yau's conjecture (about the existence of infinitely many minimal hypersurfaces) in the positive Ricci curvature setting. We will give an overview of these results, describe our current efforts to develop the theory further and discuss future directions. Among the most recent developments, we will describe our work on the problems of the Morse index and multiplicity of min-max minimal hypersurfaces. Most of the material covered in these lectures is based on joint work with Andre Neves.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Speaker\r\n\r\nFernando Codá dos Santos Cavalcanti Marques is a Brazilian mathematician working mainly in geometry, topology and partial differential equations. He is a professor at Princeton University. In 2012, together with André Neves, he proved the Willmore conjecture.\r\n\r\nFernando Marques obtained his Ph.D. from Cornell University in 2003, under the supervision of José Fernando Escobar. He worked at the IMPA from 2003 to 2014. On September 1, 2014, Marques joined Princeton University as a full professor.\r\n\r\nSome of his best known works are the following:\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with André Neves, the solution to the Willmore conjecture (2012). Marques and Neves \"Min-max theory and the Willmore conjecture\" was uploaded to arXiv on February 2012, in it they solved the Willmore conjecture, using Almgren–Pitts min-max theory.\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with Ian Agol and André Neves, the solution to the Freedman–He–Wang conjecture (2012)\r\n\r\nIn cooperation with Simon Brendle and André Neves, a counter-example to the rigidity conjecture of Min-Oo (2010)\r\n\r\nHe was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) of 2010 in Hyderabad, and a plenary speaker at the ICM of 2014 in Seoul.

The predictive power of MD however comes at a steep computational price, limiting the system sizes and simulation times that can be achieved in practice. While the size limitation can be efficiently addressed with massively parallel computers, the same approach cannot extend the timescales much beyond microseconds. I will discuss an alternative, parallel-in-time, strategy – the Parallel Replica Dynamics (ParRep) method – that aims at addressing the timescale limitation of MD for systems that evolve through rare state-to-state transitions. I will review the theoretical foundations of the method and demonstrate its usefulness by reviewing different examples of mate rials simulations where access to long timescales (up to 10,000 times longer than with MD alone) was essential to study the physical processes of interest.\r\n个人简介：Research Scientist in Theoretical Division T-1 (Physics and Chemistry of Materials).

Because electrical energy in supercapacitors is stored based on physical phenomena rather than chemical reaction (as in batteries), supercapacitors have fast rates of charge/discharge and a virtually limitless number of charge cycles. Much of the goal of supercapacitor research is aimed at increasing the amount of energy stored (energy density is the strong point in favor of batteries), which in turn focuses attention on the electrolyte, the nature of the electrode, and the electrode-electrolyte interactions.\r\nTo date, ionic liquids (ILs) have become emerging candidates for electrolytes used in supercapacitors; meanwhile carbons are the most widely used electrode materials in supercapacitors. To improve the energy density and the transport properties of the charge carriers in supercapacitors, carbons have been developed in diverse forms such as activated carbons, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), onion-like carbons (OLCs), carbode-derived carbons and graphene. Using molecular modeling combined with molecular experimental probes, such as SAXS, SANS, NMR, and AFM, we report on our investigations into the interfacial phenomena occurring between the IL electrolytes and electrodes of varying geometries to understand the energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors that rely on EDLs established at IL-electrode interfaces.\r\n\r\n报告人介绍\r\nCummings教授1976年本科毕业于澳大利亚纽卡斯尔大学（University of Newcastle）数学系，1980年于澳大利亚墨尔本大学（University of Melbourne）获得博士学位；1980-1981年在加拿大圭尔夫大学从事博士后研究；于1983年加入美国弗吉尼亚大学化学工程系，并于1991-1993年担任教授职位。2007-2013年，Cummings教授任美国橡树岭国家实验室纳米材料科学中心首席科学家，2002年至今，任美国范德堡大学化学工程系John R.

Yet until today we don't have a good understanding of what are surely the simplest mathematical tests pertaining to their \"reality''. To be precise black holes are explicit mathematical solutions of the Einstein field equations. The certainly exist as beautiful mathematical objects but in order to correspond to physical, ``observable'', objects they have to verify certain simple to state mathematical properties such as: rigidity, stability and the possibility that they can form from reasonable initial configurations, free of black holes, - this latter is the well known problem of collapse. In my lecture I will describe these mathematical problems and give a broad overview of recent results.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Speaker:\r\n\r\n\r\nSergiu Klainerman is a mathematician known for his contributions to the study of hyperbolic differential equations and general relativity. He is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University, a position he held since 1987. Since 2011, he is a Higgins professor of Mathematics, Princeton University. From 1980 to 1987 he was a faculty member at New York University.\r\n\r\nKlainerman is a PDE analyst with a strong interest in General Relativity. His current research deals with the mathematical theory of black holes more precisely on their rigidity and stability. He is also interested in the dynamic formation of trapped surfaces and singularities.\r\n\r\nKlainerman is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (elected 2005), a foreign member of the French Academy of Sciences (elected 2002) and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1996).\r\n\r\nHe was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1991 and Guggenheim Fellow in 1997. Klainerman was awarded the B&ocirc;cher Memorial Prize by the American Mathematical Society in 1999 \"for his contributions to nonlinear hyperbolic equations\". He is currently a Editor of Annals of Mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergiu_Klainerman\r\n\r\nhttps://web.math.princeton.edu/~seri/homepage/seri.htm\r\n\r\n","speaker":{"name":"Sergiu Klainerman","affiliation":" 普林斯顿大学希金斯讲座教授 美国国家科学院院士 法国科学院外籍院士 美国人文与科学院院士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:19:11Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94519ed5dbfb32993531","type":0,"title":"Eureka:固体“宇宙”中的外尔费米子","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学理科楼郑裕彤大讲堂"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-05T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-05T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"1929年德国数学家和物理学家外尔在狄拉克方程的基础上预言一种无质量的具有相反“手性”的粒子，被称为外尔费米子，但因为其违反“左右”对称性（即宇称守恒）而未被广泛接受。1957年杨振宁和李政道提出宇称不守恒后，人们很快意识到中微子就是一种具有“左手性”的外尔费米子。但1998年以来发现的中微子振荡（今年的诺贝尔物理学奖）－即具有微小质量－又否定了它的外尔费米子属性，这也使宇宙中是否存在“外尔”基本粒子成为一个科学之迷。 \r\n\r\n  在固体材料中的“宇宙”中，亿万个电子通过相互作用能形成一种决定其母体材料性质的“准粒子”，这些准粒子与基本粒子可能遵循相同的物理规律，例如2004发现的石墨稀就具有无质量狄拉克费米子的“准粒子”。近年来拓扑材料的快速发展为在固体材料中观测外尔费米子提供了新的思路和途径。在这个报告中我将介绍我们是如何在TaAs单晶中发现外尔费米子和它的一些奇特性质和潜在应用。\r\n\r\n个人简介：丁洪，北京凝聚态国家实验室常务副主任和首席科学家。1990年毕业于上海交通大学，1995年获美国伊利诺伊大学芝加哥分校的物理博士。1995年至1998年在美国阿贡国家实验室做博士后。1998年至2008年在美国波士顿学院大学物理系历任助理教授、副教授、正教授。2008年至今为中科院物理所的全职研究员。长期从事凝聚态物理的实验研究，主要利用光电子能谱研究高温超导体和新奇量子材料的电子结构和物理机理，取得了若干个被国际同行广泛认可的重要成果。在学术期刊上发表了160多篇学术论文，被SCI引用超过9000次。1999年获美国的斯隆奖，2008年入选首批国家“千人计划”，2011年被选为美国物理学会会士 。","speaker":{"name":"丁洪","affiliation":" 中科院物理所研究员 北京凝聚态国家实验室常务副主任和首席科学家","bio":"丁洪，北京凝聚态国家实验室常务副主任和首席科学家。1990年毕业于上海交通大学，1995年获美国伊利诺伊大学芝加哥分校的物理博士。1995年至1998年在美国阿贡国家实验室做博士后。1998年至2008年在美国波士顿学院大学物理系历任助理教授、副教授、正教授。2008年至今为中科院物理所的全职研究员。长期从事凝聚态物理的实验研究，主要利用光电子能谱研究高温超导体和新奇量子材料的电子结构和物理机理，取得了若干个被国际同行广泛认可的重要成果。在学术期刊上发表了160多篇学术论文，被SCI引用超过9000次。1999年获美国的斯隆奖，2008年入选首批国家“千人计划”，2011年被选为美国物理学会会士 。"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:19:13Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94529ed5dbfb32993532","type":0,"title":"The Physics and Roles of AGN Feedback in Galaxies and Galaxy Clusters","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学蒙民伟科技南楼S727"},"time":{"from":"2016-05-05T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"物理系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"The astonishing phenomena of AGN feedback eject a tremendous amount of energy and possibly momentum into their environs, and are commonly believed to play a key role in cosmic structure evolution.

By utilizing the electron spin rather than charge, spintronic technologies answer this challenge by offering the opportunity to realize dissipation free data storage and logic devices. Skyrmions have recently been promoted as a low-power, highly scalable spintronic technology. These unique looped spin textures host a range of fascinating phenomena due to their topologically protected quantum state, and offer great potential for low dissipation magnetic information storage. We have recently demonstrated the realization of room temperature artificial Bloch skyrmion lattices over extended areas in their ground state by patterning asymmetric magnetic nanodots with controlled circularity on a PMA underlayer [1]. Another promising route to achieving highly energy-efficient spintronic devices is magneto-ionic control of metal/oxide heterostructures. We have demonstrated effective magneto-ionic manipulation of GdFe/NiCoO interfaces due to a redox-driven oxygen migration, manifested through the interface-sensitive exchange bias effect [2]. We further show that the magnetoelectric coupling moderated by voltage-driven oxygen migration extends beyond the interface region in relatively thick AlOx/GdOx/Co(15 nm) films [3]. These results show promising new approaches towards future spin-based nanoelectronics. This work has been supported by the NSF (DMR-1008791, ECCS-1232275, and DMR-1543582), NRC and DOC. \r\n1. D. A.

Building practical quantum network calls for long coherence time and feasibly scale-up physical systems. In recent 10 years, point defects with individual controllable spins come into the focus due to their scalability, ability of interacting with photons, and long coherence times. One most promising system is the nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond. In this talk, we will start by introducing the multi-qubit quantum register composed of an electron spin and several nuclear spins around, the ways to operate them and their coherence properties. By designing photonic structures, we increase the photon collection efficiency which leads to ways of high fidelity spin readout. Emission based and absorption based quantum optical interfaces are realized based on these techniques. We will discuss how to build scalable quantum networks from these two approaches. In the end, progress in other solid state qubit systems like vacancies in SiC, rare earth ion dopant in YAG crystal will be discussed. \r\n个人简介：杨森毕业于清华大学物理系基础科学班，在加州大学圣迭戈分校从事关于半导体量子阱里激子的量子现象的研究，于2009年获得物理博士学位。目前在德国斯图加特大学第三物理研究所从事基于固体点缺陷的量子光学的研究。","speaker":{"name":"杨森","affiliation":" 斯图加特大学","bio":"杨森毕业于清华大学物理系基础科学班，在加州大学圣迭戈分校从事关于半导体量子阱里激子的量子现象的研究，于2009年获得物理博士学位。目前在德国斯图加特大学第三物理研究所从事基于固体点缺陷的量子光学的研究。"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:19:31Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94649ed5dbfb32993542","type":0,"title":"新材料及新性能的大设计探讨","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学理科楼C109"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-28T02:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-28T03:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&低维量子物理国家重点实验室&物理系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"当前，我们正处于充满挑战和竞争时代。如何才能发现更多新材料、新特性,和新器件,这是代表全球科学研究和战略发展的趋势。本报告在总结新材料和新特性的发展前沿的基础上, 提出和讨论一些设计和研究新材料的新观点和正在尝试的新方法，以期获得新型功能材料及新的功能特性，期望对于如何设计新型电子材料，自旋电子材料，多电功能材料，或设计新型电子，自旋，光学等特性，以及对材料基因组等研究有所借鉴。 \r\n本报告也总结我们在高压诱导大幅度增加铁基超导电流及机制，Rashba BiTeCl 体系中的费米面拓扑转变的结果，silicene, 热电，及多铁材料研究的一些重要结果。 并着重讨论自旋零带半导体的新的进展，并将提出它们的一些新的物理概念及其在下一代自旋电子学中的应用。也会共同探讨一下三个材料和性能探索的终极问题。物质、材料及性能越来越复杂，还应该有更多新材料、新物质及新物质粒子、新奇异性能等存在并等待被探索。它们还有多少？它们是什么？如何找到它们？\r\n个人简介：王晓临，澳大利亚Wollongong大学，超导与电子材料研究所教授与副所长，自旋与电子材料研究组组长，澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow，澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者。\r\n山东大学物理本科及固体物理硕士，2000年在澳大利亚Wollongong大学获材料科学博士学位。曾先后在奥地利、日本、美国著名大学研究机构从事研究工作。研究领域广泛，涵盖新型功能材料的设计及其试验和理论研究、涉及超导材料、自旋电子材料、磁性铁电材料、热电材料等。尤其在新材料设计方面，在国际上首次独创提出了自旋零带半导体 (Spin gapless Semiconductors) 新型材料，已在国际上被试验和理论验证。在国际著名杂志上发表论文超过300篇，很多重要工作发表国际顶级杂志，如：Nature Materials, Science Advances, Physical Review Letters, Advanced Materials, Advanced Functional Materials等。论文引用近6000 多次。曾获得英女王伊丽莎白二世学者称号、美国材料学会和国际超导技术中心奖，和 WOLLONGONG大学校长合作奖。近年来以项目带头人身份承担了十多项澳大利亚基金项目，项目经费超过1000万澳元。现为澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow, 澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者。","speaker":{"name":"王晓临","affiliation":" 澳大利亚伍伦贡 (卧龙岗)大学 超导与电子材料研究所教授与副所长，澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow，澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者","bio":"王晓临，澳大利亚Wollongong大学，超导与电子材料研究所教授与副所长，自旋与电子材料研究组组长，澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow，澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者。\r\n山东大学物理本科及固体物理硕士，2000年在澳大利亚Wollongong大学获材料科学博士学位。曾先后在奥地利、日本、美国著名大学研究机构从事研究工作。研究领域广泛，涵盖新型功能材料的设计及其试验和理论研究、涉及超导材料、自旋电子材料、磁性铁电材料、热电材料等。尤其在新材料设计方面，在国际上首次独创提出了自旋零带半导体 (Spin gapless Semiconductors) 新型材料，已在国际上被试验和理论验证。在国际著名杂志上发表论文超过300篇，很多重要工作发表国际顶级杂志，如：Nature Materials, Science Advances, Physical Review Letters, Advanced Materials, Advanced Functional Materials等。论文引用近6000 多次。曾获得英女王伊丽莎白二世学者称号、美国材料学会和国际超导技术中心奖，和 WOLLONGONG大学校长合作奖。近年来以项目带头人身份承担了十多项澳大利亚基金项目，项目经费超过1000万澳元。现为澳大利亚物理学院 Fellow, 澳大利亚国家教授级未来学者。"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:19:32Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94669ed5dbfb32993543","type":0,"title":"高速定量磁共振生物标记物成像","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学郑裕彤医学楼D326"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-27T06:00:00Z","to":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"报告\r\n随着国家脑计划的逐步开展和中国医疗逐渐走向精准和个体医疗阶段，对于磁共振成像技术的成像速度和成像的可靠性的要求越来越高。浙江大学脑影像科学技术中心在3T成像仪安装完成的一年中，针对在活体中的结构、功能、生理和病变过程，进行一系列成像技术研究，重点发展高时空分辨、高精度、快速、多模态参数技术，并为生理建模提供中尺度(mesoscale)的定量基础支撑。在这次讲座中我将对我们的一些初步工作作简要介绍，与清华同仁共同讨论。","speaker":{"name":"钟健晖","affiliation":" 教授，浙江大学生物医学工程与仪器学院、浙江大学脑影像科学与技术中心"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:19:34Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94679ed5dbfb32993544","type":0,"title":"Photoacoustic imaging and focusing in deep biological tissue","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学精仪系系馆4304大会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-26T07:20:00Z","to":"2016-04-26T08:20:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"精仪系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"\r\nTaking advantage of rich molecular contrasts and safe non-ionizing radiation, optical imaging has been playing increasingly important roles in biomedical applications. However, a fundamental limit of optical imaging in biological tissue is light diffusion, which prohibits high-resolution imaging at depths beyond ~1mm. To break through this limit, Dr. Lidai Wang recently developed photoacoustic imaging and wavefront shaping technologies for in vivo functional imaging, early cancer detection, and focusing light into diffusive regimes. This presentation will first discuss the development of functional photoacoustic imaging modalities which, for the first time, achieved real-time quantitative imaging of oxygen release from single red blood cells in living tissue and enabled measurement of extremely slow blood flow in deep tissue. Then he will present a novel technique named nonlinear photoacoustic guided wavefront shaping (nonlinear-PAWS) that can effectively focus light to its diffraction limit in highly scattering media such as deep biological tissue.\r\nBiography\r\nLidai Wang received the Bachelor and Master degrees from the Tsinghua University, and received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Toronto.

I will discuss two examples to demonstrate the impact of GBs on the chemical and catalytic properties of nanomaterials. In the first example, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was used to probe epitaxial graphene and its interaction with gas molecules. I found that the GBs in graphene on Ru substrate are extremely susceptible to chemical attack by water, which can cut the graphene along GBs, followed by the intercalation of water under the graphene. This process produced a lot of graphene flakes, and I further revealed the superlubric sliding and electronic screening effect of the flakes using STM. In the second, I explored the role of GBs in metal nanoparticles for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. I prepared defect-rich metal nanoparticles using e-beam evaporation and quantified the average GB density by transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic activity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 and CO is directly correlated with GB density in metal nanoparticles. This is the first quantitative study of GB effect in electrocatalysis, and provides a new design principle for nanoparticle electrocatalysts.","speaker":{"name":"冯小峰 （Xiaofeng Feng）","affiliation":" Stanford University","position":"博士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:19:38Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de946c9ed5dbfb32993547","type":0,"title":"Parallel Sparse Matrix Algorithms for Large-Scale Computer Simulations","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"FIT1-315, Tsinghua University"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-26T01:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-26T02:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"计算机科学与技术系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"\r\nComputer modeling of physical phenomena plays an increasingly important role in science and engineering.

Unexpectedly, the resulting pressure-temperature phase diagram reveals a highly unusual interplay of superconductivity with magnetism, and differs markedly from that of all known Ce-based pressure-induced superconductors. In particular, for the first time, both superconductivity and magnetism are enhanced with pressure over a broad pressure range.

It is a unique laboratory of almost all kinds of physics, at temperatures ranging from 10^9K to 20 K and densities ranging from 10^15 to 10^-23 g cm^-3.

He was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Caltech (1967-68) and an Assistant Professor at the Harvard College Observatory (1968-71). In 1971, he moved to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he became George Gamow Distinguished Professor of Astrophysics. In 2013 he moved to Berkeley, where he is a Visiting Scholar in the UC Berkeley Astronomy Department. In 1990 Prof. McCray received the Dannie S. Heinemann Prize for Astrophysics of the American Physical Society. In 1989 he was elected to National Academy of Sciences. In 2002 he was awarded the National Science Foundation Director's Award for Distinguished Teaching Scholars.\r\nProf. McCray's research is in the theory and observations of the dynamics of the interstellar gas and cosmic X-ray sources, supernovae and supernova remnants. For almost 30 years, he has been deeply engaged in the study of the evolution of Supernova 1987A, through both theoretical modeling and observations with major observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Very Large Telescope and, most recently, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Beginning in 1984, Professor McCray has visited China many times. He has had a long and productive relationship with Chinese astrophysicists. He has helped to organize several international symposia and summer schools on astrophysics in China and he has supervised the Ph.D. research of three Chinese graduate students. In 1996, he was appointed as Concurrent Professor of Astrophysics at Nanjing University.","speaker":{"name":"Richard McCray","affiliation":" University of California, Berkeley"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:20:05Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94879ed5dbfb3299355c","type":0,"title":"清华大学清洁能源讲坛系列报告之二十八：Turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard and Taylor-Couette flow","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"Lecture Hall, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-21T06:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-21T07:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学热能工程系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"报告Rayleigh-Bénard flow — the flow in a box heated from below and cooled from above — and Taylor-Couette flow -- the flow between two coaxial co- or counter-rotating cylinders -- are the two paradigmatic systems in physics of fluids and many new concepts have been tested with them. They are mathematically well described, namely by the Navier-Stokes equations and the respective boundary conditions.While the low Reynolds number regime (i.e., weakly driven systems) has been very well explored in the '80s and '90s of the last century, in the fully turbulent regime major research activity only developed in the last decade. This was also possible thanks to the advancement of computational power and improved algorithms and nowadays numerical simulations of such systems can even be done in the so-called ultimate regime of turbulence, in which even the boundary layers become turbulent. In this talk we review this recen progress in our understanding of fully developed Rayleigh-Bénard and Taylor-Couette turbulence, from the experimental, theoretical, and numerical point of view, focusing on the latter. We will explain the parameter dependences of the global transport properties of the flow and the local flow organisation, including velocity profiles and boundary layers, which are closely connected to the global properties. Next, we will discuss transitions between different (turbulent) flow states.报告人介绍：Detlef Lohse graduated from the University of Bonn in 1989 with a degree in Physics, and completed his PhD at the University of Marburg in 1992.

For a few months, the exploding star is more luminous than one billion suns. Such supernovae are responsible for creating the heavy elements in the universe, including the material of which the Earth is composed. In fact, the iron in our blood and the calcium in our bones were created in a supernova explosion that occurred about 5 billion years ago. During the past 2000 years, about 20 supernovae have been bright enough to see with the naked eye. Chinese astronomers provided the earliest detailed records of supernovae, giving their locations in the sky and the evolution of their brightness. Today, astronomers can pointmodern telescopes toward these ancient supernovae and see expanding shells of hot gas caused by the explosions.\r\nSupernovae manifest some of the most extreme environments in the physical universe, with temperatures ranging from 109 K to &lt; 100 K and densities ranging from 1015 g cm-3 to 10-23 g cm-3. They produce neutron stars and black holes. To probe the conditions in supernovae and their remnants, astronomers use telescopes spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from radio to gamma rays.\r\nWith modern telescopes, astronomers are now discovering hundreds of supernovae each year and learning what kinds of stars explode as supernovae, what factors determine their behavior, and their influence on the evolution of the cosmos. We now understand that supernovae are essential to the origin of life in the universe. Because of supernovae, the universe has found a way to create (at least one) intelligent civilization. We can regard civilizations as devices whereby the universe becomes conscious of itself. \r\n","speaker":{"name":"Richard McCray","affiliation":" 美国科罗拉多大学教授 美国科学院院士 美国Dannie S.

On the other hand, two-dimensional systems with contact interactions are characterized by continuous scale invariance and support no Efimov physics. This raises questions about the behaviour of three-body recombination in the transition from three to two dimensions. We use ultracold caesium atoms trapped in anisotropic potentials formed by a pair of counter-propagating laser beams to experimentally investigate three-body recombination in quasi-two-dimensional systems with tunable confinement and tunable interactions. In our recent experiments, we observed a smooth transition of the three-body recombination rate coefficient from a three-dimensional to a deeply quasi-two-dimensional system. A comparison between the results obtained near two Feshbach resonances indicates a universal behaviour of three-body recombination in the quasi-two-dimensional regime. I will also talk about our related results on the second Efimov resonance and temperature effects on an Efimov resonance. \r\n个人简介：黄博\r\nScientific Career\r\n08.2015 – Post-Doc at IQOQI, Innsbruck, Austria.\r\n02.2010 – 07.2015 PhD work at Universit&auml;t Innsbruck, Austria\r\n11.2008 – 12.2009 Master study at Universit&auml;t Innsbruck and IQOQI, Innsbruck, Austria.\r\n09.2004 – 07.2008 Studies of physics (Bachelor), School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China\r\nPublications\r\n[1]Bose-Einstein Condensation of Strontium,Simon Stellmer, Meng Khoon Tey, Bo Huang, Rudolf Grimm, Florian Schreck,Phys.

The nature of human forebrain activity related to neural responses in the human thalamic principal sensory nucleus (Vc) to painful, nonpainful thermal and mechanical stimuli are characterized by low threshold calcium spike (LTS) bursts as well as single action potentials. Neurons responding to painful and cold stimuli are more likely to fire with\r\nLTS bursts during the presentation of these stimuli. Thalamic spike trains firing with LTS bursts are more likely than single spikes to activate cortex.Thalamic microstimulation with these burst patterns is more likely to produce the sensation of pain and temperature than other patterns, particularly in chronic pain patients.\r\nThalamic activity will influence pain perception based upon connectivity with the cortical networks, which have been suggested by changes in hemodynamic activity in imaging studies. The connections and connectional weights in these networks were demonstrated by studies of cortical LFPs, which have demonstrated that the pain related networks in the nociceptive pain networks are not fixed but change rapidly with changes in task and time relative to the stimulus. Lesions and chronic pain cause substantial reorganization of these networks. Finally, these results suggest specific therapies for acute and chronic pain based upon new targets for neuromodulation or for specific application of drugs that influence LTS burst firing.\r\nThis work was supported by NIH-NINDS NS38493 and by the Hopkins Neurosurgery Pain Research Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n图片为Dr. Frederick A.

Cold collisions not only give rise to coherent interactions for quantum gas control but also can result in loss processes that limit the time scale for such control. These lectures will cover the basic concepts of cold atomic and molecular collisions, including tunable resonant control. Well-studied experimental systems will be used as case studies to illustrate the concepts and to introduce several topics of current research interest.\r\n\r\nLecture 1: Cold Collision Basics\r\nApril 19 (Tuesday) 2016 10:00 a.m.\r\n\r\nThis lecture describes how to describe cold collisions quantum mechanically, with emphasis on scattering and bound state properties near a collision threshold that are relevant to cold atom studies, emphasizing especially the role of the long range potential between two interacting atoms. The key concept of the scattering length represents a phase shift that gives a unique \"quantum personality\" to the interactions of a pair of cold atoms and determines the properties of a quantum degenerate cold atomic gas. The 7 isotopes of the Yb atom make a good test case of threshold scattering and bound state properties, and help to illustrate the powerful \"quantum defect\" concept.\r\n\r\nLecture 2: Feshbach Resonances I\r\nApril 19 (Tuesday) 2016 2:30 p.m. \r\n\r\nMagnetically tunable scattering resonances known as Feshbach resonances permit the control of the interactions of cold bosonic or fermionic atoms, as demonstrated by a wide variety of applications. This lecture shows how to understand such resonances, for which the dimensionless parameter which characterizes their intrinsic strength ranges over more than 5 order of magnitude among experimentally known resonances . The properties and uses of magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances will be illustrated by examples successfully used in experimental work.\r\n\r\nLecture 3: Feshbach Resonances II\r\nApril 21 (Thursday) 2016 10:00 a.m. \r\n\r\nThis lecture continues a discussion of Feshbach resonances, introducing two topics relevant to ongoing research. One is overlapping or interfering resonances, which are important in several practical cases of active research. The other is the case of optically tunable resonances, which serve as an example of a class of resonances that exhibit loss due to spontaneous irreversible decay. This lecture shows how to compare optical Feshbach resonances to magnetic ones, and explains the conditions of laser detuning and intensity under which control of the scattering length can be obtained. Light shifts due to off-resonant optical coupling may also control quantum gases with minimal losses.\r\n\r\nLecture 4: Universality in Atomic and Molecular Collisions\r\nApril 21(Thursday) 2016 2:30 p.m. \r\n\r\nThe concept of \"universality,” that is, having scattering properties that are independent of the details of complex short range chemical interactions, is a powerful one in ultracold physics, since only the scattering length is needed to characterize few-body and many-body physics in this domain. Extending the concept to include also the length scale of the long-range potential greatly enhances our understanding, illustrated by precision binding energy measurements, determination of the effective range, and calculation of few-body dynamics. In the case of highly reactive or inelastic molecular collisions, the concept of long-range universality can be extended to understand the magnitude of collisional losses for a broad class of molecular collisions.\r\n\r\nLecture 5: Other Topics in Cold Collisions\r\nApril 22 (Friday) 2016 10:00 a.m. \r\n\r\nThe lecture series concludes by exploring some additional topics that are relevant to current research areas. These include chaotic dynamics with complex atoms or molecules, which have dense sets of overlapping resonances but may also have some universal properties. The effect of reduced dimension, or tight quantum confinement, on cold collisions will be examined for some aspects of atomic and molecular collisions.\r\n\r\n个人介绍: Paul S. Julienne obtained his Ph.

It offers a valuable balance between electrochemical activity, chemical stability, and thermomechanical compatibility with the widely used electrolyte, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ). Despite its widespread implementation, questions regarding the reaction pathway for oxygen electroreduction on this material remain open. Here, a fundamental study of the reduction mechanism is carried using thin film methods. Libraries of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95MnO3+δ (LSM) thin film microelectrodes with systematically varied thickness or growth temperature were prepared by pulsed laser deposition, and a novel robotic instrument was used to characterize these libraries in automated fashion by impedance spectroscopy. All impedance trends are consistent with a reaction pathway involving oxygen reduction over the LSM surface followed by diffusion through the film and into the electrolyte substrate. The surface activity is found to be correlated with the number of exposed grain boundary sites, which decreases with either increasing film thickness (at constant growth temperature) or increasing film growth temperature (at constant thickness). These findings suggest that exposed grain boundaries in LSM films are more active than exposed grains towards the rate-limiting surface process, and that oxygen ion diffusion through polycrystalline LSM films is faster than several prior studies have concluded.报告人介绍：Brief BiographySossina M. Haile is the Walter P. Murphy Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University, a position she assumed in 2015 after serving 18 years on the faculty at the California Institute of Technology. She earned her Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992. Haile’s research broadly encompasses solid state ionic materials and devices, with particular focus on energy technologies. She has established a new class of fuel cells based on solid acid electrolytes and demonstrated record power densities for solid oxide fuel cells. Her more recent work on water dissociation for solar-fuel generation by thermochemical processes has created new avenues for harnessing sunlight to meet rising energy demands.

To realize an areal density of higher than 2 Tbit/in2 in the future, both media and readers need technical breakthroughs. Since the bit size will be in the range of 20 nm, the magnetic grains in the recording media must be reduced to less than 6 nm, requiring the use of ferromagnetic materials with high magnetocrystalline anisotropy such as L10 FePt. The shield-to-shield spacing of read sensors must also be smaller than 20 nm with low device resistance (resistance-area product RA~0.1 &#61527;&#61549;m2), which is very difficult to achieve using MgO based tunneling magnetoresistance devices. In this talk, we will address the materials challenges to the realization of an ideal media nanostructure using L10 FePt for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) media and narrow readers for &gt; 2 Tbit/in2 areal density. Recently significant progress has been made in current-perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistive (CPP-GMR) devices using highly spin-polarized Heusler alloy ferromagnetic layers and new spacer materials. The very high magnetoresistance ratios achieved in CPP-GMR are encouraging for future read head applications of CPP-GMR, or its laterally extended version, lateral spin valves. The devices with high magnetoresistive output at low RA may open new applications in addition to disk read heads.\r\nBio:Kazuhiro Hono received the BS and MS degrees in Materials Science from Tohoku University in 1982 and 1984, respectively, and a Ph.D. degree in Metals Science and Engineering from Penn State in 1988.

Understanding the twinning mechanisms in TWIP steels is essential for the successful application of TWIP steels in automotive industry. The first part of this work is to employ sub-micon and micron-sized single crystalline pillars to investigate the nucleation and growth mechanism of deformation twins. It is found that the nucleation and growth of deformation twins are due to emission and glide of successive partial dislocations. The twin thickness can range from nanometres to micrometres. A physical model is proposed to simulate the nucleation and growth of deformation twins and the model predictions agree well with experimental observations. The second part of this work investigates the deformation mechanism of bulk samples in TWIP steels. Deformation mechanism at high strain rates were investigated. By synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments, the present work demonstrates that a higher strain rate leads to a lower dislocation density and a lower twinning probability, which is opposite to other fcc metals. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in our latest works that the contribution of twins to the flow stress is limited.Instead, dislocations, via forest hardening, account for up to ~90% of the flow stress increment after yielding in the present TWIP steel. In other words, the contribution of twins to the work-hardening rate and flow stress of TWIP steels may have been overestimated in the literature.\r\nShort Bio:Dr. Huang received his BEng and MPhil in Mechanics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and his PhD in Materials Science in 2008 from Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), The Netherlands.

But humans are, also uniquely, creators of art and seekers of meaning; in this sense we rely on the humanities to structure and critique our understanding of ourselves. It is current to frame the challenges we face as a species as essentially technological undertakings, to be solved thru technological developments and thru the development of policy based in the social sciences. And yet, ironically, it is also current to frame the challenges we face as individuals as spiritual challenges, or challenges of meaning. Yet it cannot be that the challenges of the collective are in fact independent of our personal and individual challenges. This talk will explore, from the context of an engineer, the multiple and essential roles of the humanities in addressing our challenges and shaping our future.\r\n人类被定义为制造工具者，是用工具制造工具的唯一物种；唯有人类依靠工程技术人员创造生存必需的产品和工具；但也唯有人类创造艺术，追寻意义。我们依靠人文学来构建和批评人的自我认识。我们作为一个物种在面对挑战时，往往依靠技术活动或以社会科学为基础的政策发展手段来解决问题。具有讽刺意味的是，我们作为个体所面对的挑战，却往往是来自精神层面或意义层面的挑战。群体所面对的挑战无法摆脱个体所面临的挑战而存在。本演讲从一位工程师的角度出发，探讨在应对挑战与塑造未来的过程中，人文学所扮演的多元和不可或缺的角色。\r\n\r\n （本次演讲为文化素质教育讲座专场）","speaker":{"name":"James P.

Unlike conventional crystalline semiconductors, solution-processed materials are compatible with low-cost, large-area roll-to-roll processing, needing lower energy intensity for device fabrication; at the same time, solvent engineering of the materials enables tunability over their electronic and optical properties. In this talk, I will discuss the design and characterizations of optoelectronic and bioelectronic devices based on solution-processed semiconductors. Using photodetectors and solar cells as examples, I will talk about the unique structure-property correlations in solution-processed semiconductors and how these correlations can be utilized to achieve tunable device performances. I will describe the applications of our devices in energy, environmental, and biomedical sciences. \r\nBiography:Ni Zhao received her Ph.D degree in Physics from the University of Cambridge (UK) in 2008.

These hydrogels, with extremely high water content (up to 99.75% water by weight), have also been prepared by utilising renewable cellulose derivatives. Their rapid formation1b and shear-induced flow properties make these materials perfectly suited for use as injectable hydrogels for delivery of therapeutics. \r\n Polymer-inorganic composite materials can be readily prepared based on the CB[8] coupling of multivalent gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to functional copolymers. When these systems are attached onto gold surfaces intricate control is achieved over the site-selective immobilisation of colloids and peptides. This has great scope for the development of optical materials, chemical sensors2 and biological separations. Additionally, we have developed an innovative new technique for manufacturing 'smart' microcapsules in large quantities using continuous flow in a single step from tiny droplets of water.3a The major advantage of this manufacturing platform over current methods is that a variety of cargos can be efficiently loaded during the microcapsule formation at room temperature, and the dynamic supramolecular interactions provide control over the porosity of the capsules and the timed release of their contents using stimuli.3b Our CB[n] based host-guest systems exhibit dynamic self assembly and are capable of responding to stimuli (photochemical, chemical, and thermal) allowing for external control and function to be built into the materials. \r\n\r\nReferences \r\n1.

The first two lectures will give an introduction and survey of these two topics and their interrelationships, while the third and fourth will discuss more recent developments: an application of modular forms to counting the number of coverings of a torus by a surface of genus g (\"mirror symmetry in dimension one\"), a wonderful generalization of this result by Bloch and Okounkov, with a new and very simple proof, and recent joint work with Dawei Chen and Martin Moeller that generalizes and applies this theorem to questions concerning moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces.\r\n\r\nAll of the lectures will be aimed at non-experts, and are intended to be accessible to enthusiastic senior undergraduate students as well as to graduate students or researchers from other fields. At least the first talk should be understandable even for first or second year undergraduates.\r\n\r\nTALK 1: 16:30-17:30, 2016-4-6\r\n\r\nIn how many ways can you divide a set of 4 apples into smaller subsets?\r\n\r\nWe assume that the apples are identical, so only the size of the subsets counts. Then the answer is \"5 ways\", with the sizes of the subsets being (1,1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,3), (2,2), or (4). We say that 4 has 5 partitions, or p(4)=5. Partitions, first studied by Euler, are a basic object of combinatorics, and have many wonderful properties. In this lecture I will describe some of these, e.g.: how the number p(200) = 3972999029388 could be computed by hand, long before there were electronic calculators; how the study of partitions led Euler to the wonderful idea of \"generating functions\"; the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic formula for the size of p(n) when n is large; and the famous Ramanujan congruences like the divisibility of p(11n+6) by 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALK 2: 16:30-17:30, 2016-4-8\r\n\r\n\r\nModular forms have been studied for about 150 years and are among the basic tools of modern number theory. They have a dual nature: one the one hand they are functions of a complex variable with a very large non-commutative symmetry group, and on the other hand they can be seen as power series whose coefficients include many interesting arithmetical functions like partitions, sums of powers of divisors, or number of representations of integers as sums of squares. Because of this they have many applications in all parts of number theory, e.g., they played the key role in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. I will give the main concepts and lots of examples, and discuss how modular forms can be used to prove some of the properties of partitions discussed in the first lecture.\r\n\r\nTALKS 3 and 4: 16:30-17:30, 2016-4-11/13\r\n\r\nIn \"mirror symmetry\", which plays a central role in string theory as well as in several parts of modern algebraic geometry, one is interested in particular in counting the number of maps of a Riemann surface of given genus g to an n-dimensional complex manifold of a special type called Calabi-Yau varieties. For n=1 this leads to the question of counting the ramified covers of a torus (= surface of genus one = one-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold) by a surface of genus g. The answer turns out to be given by a (nearly) modular form, as discovered by Dijkgraaf and other string theorists and proved by Kaneko and myself. I will describe this theorem and then a huge generalization of it found by Bloch and Okounkov, together with a new and very simple proof of that theorem. Finally, I will describe recent joint work with Moeller and Chen that uses this connection with modular forms to solve various problems in the moduli space of surfaces, including a proof of the Eskin-Zorich conjecture on the large genus asymptotics of Masur-Veech volumes and the calculation of the so-called \"Siegel-Veech constants\" in the theory of flat surfaces.\r\n\r\nIntroduction of Speaker:\r\n\r\nDon Bernard Zagier is an American mathematician whose main area of work is number theory. He is currently one of the directors of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany. He has been a professor at the Collège de France in Paris, France from 2006 to 2014. Since October 2014, he is also a Distinguished Staff Associate at ICTP. \r\n\r\nZagier studied for three years at MIT, completing his bachelor's and master's degrees and then receiving his PhD at Oxford University. He received his Habilitation at University of Bonn. In 1976, aged only 24, he became Germany's youngest professor. \r\n\r\nZagier collaborated with Hirzebruch in work on Hilbert modular surfaces. Hirzebruch and Zagier coauthored Intersection numbers of curves on Hilbert modular surfaces and modular forms of Nebentypus, where they proved that intersection numbers of algebraic cycles on a Hilbert modular surface occur as Fourier coefficients of a modular form. \r\n\r\nOne of Zagier’s results is a joint work with Benedict Gross (the so-called Gross–Zagier formula). This formula relates the first derivative of the complex L-series of an elliptic curve evaluated at 1 to the height of a certain Heegner point. This theorem has some applications including implying cases of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture along with being an ingredient to Dorian Goldfeld's solution of the class number problem. As a part of their work, Gross and Zagier found a formula for norms of differences of singular moduli. Zagier later found a formula for traces of singular moduli as Fourier coefficients of a weight 3/2 modular form.\r\n\r\nZagier collaborated with John Harer to calculate the orbifold Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of algebraic curves, relating them to special values of the Riemann zeta function.\r\n\r\nZagier found a formula for the value of the Dedekind zeta function of an arbitrary number field at s = 2 in terms of the dilogarithm function, by studying arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds. He later formulated a general conjecture giving formulas for special values of Dedekind zeta functions in terms of polylogarithm functions. He discovered a short and elementary proof of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares.\r\n\r\nZagier won the Cole Prize in Number Theory in 1987, the von Staudt Prize in 2001 and the Gauss Lectureship of the German Mathematical Society in 2007. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997.\r\n\r\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Zagier\r\n\r\n","speaker":{"name":"Don Zagier","affiliation":" 德国马克斯&amp;#8226;普朗克数学研究所的主任 荷兰皇家艺术学院的外籍院士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:21:34Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94df9ed5dbfb32993595","type":0,"title":"费孝通学术纪念讲座：实用的虔诚：都城的仪式与德行之研究","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学熊知行楼社会学系211会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T07:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T08:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学社会学系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"speaker":{"name":"麦克尔·赫兹菲尔德（Michael Herzfeld）","affiliation":" 哈佛大学人类学系教授"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:21:35Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de94e09ed5dbfb32993596","type":0,"title":"Watching and Controlling Single Molecules in nm-scale Plasmonic Cavities","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学理科楼C302"},"time":{"from":"2016-04-06T07:30:00Z","to":"2016-04-06T08:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&物理系&低维量子物理国家重点实验室","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"Coupling betweenplasmonicnano-components generates strongly red-shifted resonances combined with intense local field amplification on the nanoscale.

This large disparity in the number of photonic and electronic devices on the same chip arises because of the limitation in how small conventional silicon photonic devices can be made. In this talk we shall describe our recent work in two different approaches to enable the integration of smaller photonic devices. One approach for smaller photonic devices is to exploit the guiding of light at metal-dielectric interfaces from surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) modes. Plasmonic devices not only offer the advantage of smaller size, but in the case of optical modulators they can also provide higher energy efficiency and high speed operation. One important challenge for plasmonic devices on silicon chips is how to couple light efficiently into the plasmonic device. We shall present some of the different designs of nanophotonic couplers to couple light efficiently from a conventional silicon waveguide to a plasmonic slot waveguide. Another approach to make smaller photonic devices is to exploit the photonic bandgap of nanophotonic structures for highly compact resonators, filters or polarizers. Unlike convention photonic crystals which require high precision in the periodicity of the photonic lattice, photonic bandgaps from hyperuniform disordered structures are more tolerant to fabrication errors. We shall describe a waveguide polarizer with over 30 dB extinction ratio over a 98 nm optical bandwidth that occupies a short length of 8 μm (including the waveguide tapers) based on a hyperuniform disordered photonic bandgap structure.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker: \r\nHon Ki Tsang received the B.A. (Hons) degree in 1987 in Engineering (Electrical and Information Sciences), and the Ph.D. and M.A. degrees in 1991, all from the University of Cambridge.

Optomechanical systems have shown their unique advantages in fundamental research as well as practical applications in high-precision metrology, signal processing, and data communication. Optomechanical devices exhibit many variations with their sizes and mechanical masses spanning orders of magnitude. Going to the other end of the spectrum, I will talk about our experimental research of integrated nanoscale optomechanical and optoelectromechanical devices with pico/femtogram masses and gigahertz vibrational frequencies. These integrated devices hold great promise for many burgeoning areas in science and engineering, such as single-molecule detection, laser cooling, and quantum information processing. \r\n\r\nAbout the speaker: \r\nXiankai Sun received his Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics from California Institute of Technology, USA, in 2010.

However, another type of gravitational waves produced during inflation echo in the very beginning of the Universe has yet been detected. The most sensitive approach searching this primordial gravitational waves is by observing the polarization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Several dedicated CMB experiments have been operating or under construction at the South Pole Station and the Atacama desert in Chile, in particular the BICEP series of experiment have been the most sensitive and successful experiment for this purpose. We have proposed to build the first Chinese CMB experiment at the Ali Observatory in Tibet.

In the global era, universities are assuming a critical and more prominent role in the advancement of knowledge in service to the world. Going forward, it is international collaboration between and among universities – and across disciplines in the arts, sciences, and humanities – that will drive innovation, engagement and solutions/approaches to complex global challenges like climate change, population health and sustainable development.\r\n\r\n演讲嘉宾：克里斯蒂娜·派克森（Christina Paxson）\r\nChristina Paxson is the nineteenth president of Brown University and Professor of Economics and Public Policy.\r\n\r\nAs president, she has worked with students, faculty and staff to develop Building on Distinction, a strategic plan for Brown that will inform the University’s next decade of growth and progress. The plan seeks to build on the progress of the last decade and provides a vision and set of broad goals to achieve higher levels of distinction as a university that unites innovative education and outstanding research to benefit the community, the nation and the world. It calls for targeted investments to attract and support the most talented and diverse faculty, students, and staff; capitalize on existing strengths; and provide the environment to foster rigorous inquiry and discovery across the disciplines. The plan highlights the need to keep a Brown education affordable for talented students from all economic backgrounds and to sustain a community with the diversity of thought and experience required for excellence.\r\n\r\nPrior to her appointment as President in July 2012, she was dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University.\r\n\r\nA 1982 honors graduate of Swarthmore College, Phi Beta Kappa, Paxson earned her graduate degrees in economics at Columbia University (M.A., 1985; Ph.D., 1987). She began her academic career at Princeton University in 1986, becoming assistant professor of economics and public affairs the next year. She became a full professor in 1997 and was named the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Economics and Public Affairs in 2007. While at Princeton, Paxson also served as associate chair (2005-2008) and chair (2008-2009) of the Department of Economics and was the founding director of a National Institute on Aging Center for the Economics and Demography of Aging. In 2000, she founded the Center for Health and Wellbeing, an interdisciplinary research center in the Woodrow Wilson School. The center established multidisciplinary graduate and undergraduate certificate programs in health and health policy. She served as the center’s director until 2009.\r\n\r\nInitially working on international economic problems of labor supply, mobility, savings, inequality, and aging, Paxson focused increasingly on the relationship of economic factors to health and welfare over the life course, particularly on the health and welfare of children. She has been the principal investigator on a number of research projects supported by the National Institutes of Health, including a study of adversity and resilience after Hurricane Katrina. She has authored or co-authored numerous journal articles, was elected vice president of the American Economic Association in 2012, and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. In January 2016, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston named Paxson to its board of directors.\r\n\r\n特别提醒：\r\n1、因场地所能容纳观众人数有限，请感兴趣的同学及时进行预报名。如报名人数已满，系统将提前关闭。\r\n2、如果您想及时获知清华海外名师讲堂的最新信息，请关注清华大学信息门户“教务公告”及“学术活动”栏目。\r\n\r\n联系电话：62797498\r\n国际合作与交流处\r\n研究生院\r\n教务处\r\n\r\n\r\n附：清华海外名师讲堂简介\r\n“清华海外名师讲堂”是汇集我校高端国际交流资源，面向广大同学开办的高层次、前沿性、成系列的海外人士演讲，设有“全球领导力”和“前沿科技”两大系列。演讲人汇集诺贝尔奖得主、著名学者、外国政要、知名大学校长、跨国企业高管等名家名人。为广大同学提供了拓展国际视野和学术视野，提升外语水平和交流能力的宝贵资源。\r\n“清华海外名师讲堂”面向全校学生开放，一般每年开设20-30讲，课程采用学生IC卡记录考勤，无需选课。凡在读期间累计听讲8次并递交总结报告者，可获得1个学分（相关事宜请联系62797498）。","speaker":{"name":"克里斯蒂娜&#8226;派克森（Christina Paxson）","affiliation":" 美国布朗大学校长"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:22:15Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de95089ed5dbfb329935af","type":0,"title":"Quantum Many-Body Localization in Atomic Systems","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学理科楼三楼报告厅（C302）"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-28T08:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&物理系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"Ultracold atomic systems have witnessed rapid developments in the last decade in many aspects, and has now reached a new era where quantum correlations and many-body complexity emerge in unprecedented controllable fashion. These developments stimulate unique angles to study quantum many-body physics especially in non-equilibrium aspects. Specifically, I will discuss quantum many-body localization, a dynamical quantum phase transition at infinite temperature, in optical lattices. I will describe thermalization in an isolated quantum system in the sense of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and its breakdown in the presence of strong disorder. I will present our work on nonergodic metallic phase that arises from coexisting localized and delocalized degrees of freedom in one dimensional incommensurate lattices. The conceptual novelty of this nonergodic metallic phase lies in that it is extended in real space but \"localized\" in the high-dimensional many-body Hilbert space. Numerical evidence and theoretical arguments for this novel phase will be presented.  \r\n个人简介：\r\nDr. Xiaopeng Li received his Bachelor's degree from University of Science of Technology of China in 2008, and his Ph.D. degree from University of Pittsburgh in 2013.

In this talk, we will report the development of a discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) method for modeling multiscale transport problems based on kinetic theory. It is shown that the DUGKS has the asymptotic perseveringproperties and can serve as a self-adaptive multiscale simulation method. A number of numerical tests are carried out to validate the method, and the results demonstrate that the DUGKS can serve as an efficient numerical method for multiscale transport problems.\r\n报告人简介：郭照立，华中科技大学煤燃烧国家重点实验室教授，国家杰出青年基金获得者，长江学者特聘教授。2000年于华中科技大学获得工学博士学位，2000-2003年在华中科技大学煤燃烧国家重点实验室从事博士后研究，2003-2005年香港科技大学机械系访问学者，2005年至今在华中科技大学工作。主要从事复杂流动的介观物理模型和数值方法、微纳尺度及跨尺度流动与传热、多相多组分渗流微观机理等方面的基础研究。承担国家自然科学基金4项、973专题2项。发表SCI论文120余篇，SCI引用3000余次，SCI-H指数25；合著专著3部；获得国家自然科学二等奖1项。","speaker":{"name":"郭照立","affiliation":" 教授，华中科技大学煤燃烧国家重点实验室","bio":"郭照立，华中科技大学煤燃烧国家重点实验室教授，国家杰出青年基金获得者，长江学者特聘教授。2000年于华中科技大学获得工学博士学位，2000-2003年在华中科技大学煤燃烧国家重点实验室从事博士后研究，2003-2005年香港科技大学机械系访问学者，2005年至今在华中科技大学工作。主要从事复杂流动的介观物理模型和数值方法、微纳尺度及跨尺度流动与传热、多相多组分渗流微观机理等方面的基础研究。承担国家自然科学基金4项、973专题2项。发表SCI论文120余篇，SCI引用3000余次，SCI-H指数25；合著专著3部；获得国家自然科学二等奖1项。"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:22:18Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de950b9ed5dbfb329935b1","type":0,"title":"直接建模的计算流体力学方法和在多尺度输运过程中的应用","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学航天学院蒙民伟科技大楼北楼N414会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-28T01:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-28T02:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学航天航空学院","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"流体力学方程是对流体动力学在不同尺度上的直接描述，其中包括在连续介质尺度上的Navier-Stokes方程和分子自由程尺度上的Boltzmann方程。但在这两个尺度之间，由于非平衡流建模的复杂性，现在还没有可靠和有效的描述。理论上讲随着对观察流体尺度的变化，流体力学应该有一个连续谱的方程。虽然在历史上有很多理论方面的尝试，但并没有给出过一个清晰的随尺度变化构建方程的有效途径。传统的计算流体力学方法主要是给出偏微分方程的数值解。追求的目标是在网格大小趋于零的条件下给出方程的精确解。对于多尺度问题，如果没有这样一个连续变化的多尺度方程，计算流体力学也就变得无能为力，多数研究变成怎么把有限个分立的方程的解连接起来。如果我们摒弃计算流体力学是偏微分方程数值解的概念，把构建方程和计算结合起来，可以发展出适合多尺度、多物理流动的新方法。既然流体力学方程是在特定尺度上对流体的描述，为什么不能在网格尺度上建模、并且直接描述流体演化呢？所以直接在离散空间建模，同时构造计算流体力学格式是解决多尺度流体问题的有效途径。与直接离散偏微分方程的传统做法相比，基于离散空间直接建模构造出的数值方法考虑了网格尺度和物理模型之间的匹配，能做到不同尺度上物理过程的连续过渡，从而实现对多尺度流动的高效模拟。Boltzmann方程的跨尺度的演化解为直接建模提供了重要的支撑。本讲座将讨论直接构建计算流体力学方法的理论基础、建立统一的气体动理学格式、以及这类方法在气体动力学，辐射转移，和等离子体模拟中的成功运用。\r\n\r\n\r\n报告人简介：徐昆1987年本科毕业于北京大学，地球物理系，天体物理专业 。同年通过中美联合招收物理研究生考试(CUSPEA)，到美国纽约哥仑比亚大学天文系攻读博士学位。1993年9月取得博士学位。然后在美国普林斯顿大学机械与航空系 做博士后研究。1996年9月任职于香港科技大学数学系，助理教授（1996-2001），副教授（2001-2004），教授（2004-2013），数学系及机械航空系的讲座教授（2013-至今）。同时为北京大学工学院长江讲座教授（2008-至今）。研究领域：计算流体力学数值方法，非平衡稀薄流模拟，计算稀薄和连续流的统一算法，NS方程的高阶计算格式。","speaker":{"name":"徐昆","affiliation":" 教授，香港科技大学数学系和机械航空系","bio":"徐昆1987年本科毕业于北京大学，地球物理系，天体物理专业 。同年通过中美联合招收物理研究生考试(CUSPEA)，到美国纽约哥仑比亚大学天文系攻读博士学位。1993年9月取得博士学位。然后在美国普林斯顿大学机械与航空系 做博士后研究。1996年9月任职于香港科技大学数学系，助理教授（1996-2001），副教授（2001-2004），教授（2004-2013），数学系及机械航空系的讲座教授（2013-至今）。同时为北京大学工学院长江讲座教授（2008-至今）。研究领域：计算流体力学数值方法，非平衡稀薄流模拟，计算稀薄和连续流的统一算法，NS方程的高阶计算格式。"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:22:19Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de950d9ed5dbfb329935b2","type":0,"title":"第十二届“清华大学建筑节能学术周”","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学主楼一层报告厅"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-27T00:30:00Z","to":"2016-03-27T01:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"建筑学院","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"第十二届清华大学建筑节能学术周将于2016年3月25日~29日在清华大学举行。这一学术周是由中国工程院土木、水利与建筑工程学部主办，清华大学建筑节能研究中心承办，自2005年举办以来，在国内外学术界和各级政府及建筑节能领域的同仁的大力支持下，得到持续发展，成为国内外学术界、企业界和各级政府在建筑节能领域沟通信息，交流经验的平台，为传播建筑节能科学理念，促进建筑节能事业的发展起到一定的作用。我们希望各界朋友和我们共同携手把这个活动坚持下去，并越办越好，更期盼在建筑节能第一线工作的同志们、各级组织和管理建筑节能工作的政府工作人员们、还有一切关心建筑节能事业的社会各界朋友们能够参与这一学术周的活动，发表您们的想法，共同规划设计我国建筑节能大计，实现我国节能减排和可持续发展大业。\r\n本届建筑节能学术周的主题为聚焦全面“治霾”形势下的农村能源问题，并将发布《2016中国建筑节能年度发展研究报告》。","speaker":{"name":"江亿","affiliation":" 清华大学， 院士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:22:21Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de950e9ed5dbfb329935b3","type":0,"title":"工程物理系第155期“工物学术论坛”：Two Pre-existing Models for the 750 GeV Diphoton Resonance","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学刘卿楼219会议室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-25T08:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-25T09:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"工物系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"报告I discuss two models which I proposed, one in 1986 and the other in 2002, both of which contain new physics that can explain the 750 GeV diphoton resonance, recently observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Due to numerous challenging research problems and a wide range of applications, SA has been an active research area in many CS fields. In recent years, its research has spread from CS to social, management, and health sciences. Its applications have spread from traditional businesses, organizations, and individuals applications to conversational agents such as chatbots and intelligent personal assistants. There are now hundreds of companies in the SA space. In the first part of the tutorial, I will introduce SA and discuss the current state-of-the-art SA techniques. In the second part, I will introduce lifelong machine learning (LML), which follows naturally from the discussion of SA as LML is particularly suitable for solving SA and NLP problems. LML is different from the classic machine learning (ML) paradigm in that classic ML simply runs a learning algorithm on a given data, which we call isolated learning, while LML aims to learn as humans do. It retains and cumulates the knowledge learned in the past and uses it to help future learning and problem solving.\r\n\r\n讲演者简介\r\n\r\nBing Liu is a professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). He received his PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh.

Autonomous driving could mitigate some of the driver errors and deliver great potential for road safety as well as for road capacity. There are various degrees of autonomous driving. Among highly autonomous driving scenarios, the driver’s task would switch from a controller role to a monitoring mode. This leads to concerns over the driver being left out of the loop. How would drivers react they need to take over the vehicle control? This seminar offers some insight into this issue, based on experimental work carried out in the University of Leeds Driving Simulator.\r\n\r\n报告人简介：\r\nDr Frank Lai is a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds.

We consider a financially constrained retailer who sources from multiple suppliers, each of whom can increase its sales by providing trade credit. By offering trade credit, any given supplier relaxes the retailer’s financial constraint, which automatically benefits the other suppliers. This externality of providing trade credit is particularly detrimental when the free-riding suppliers sell substitutable products. Our model helps to explain, among other, why suppliers of differentiated products extend more trade credit than suppliers of standardized goods. In addition, our model predicts and empirically validates a negative relation between a firm's reliance on trade credit and the number of its suppliers.","speaker":{"name":"Jiri Chod, Boston College","affiliation":" Associate Professor at the Carroll School of Management, Boston College","position":"博士"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:22:49Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de952b9ed5dbfb329935c5","type":0,"title":"Magnetic wafer based magnonics","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学理科楼三楼报告厅（C302）"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-23T02:00:00Z","to":"2016-03-23T03:00:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"量子物质科学协同创新中心&物理系","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"Magnonics, which involves unified information storage and processing using magnons—spin waves that are collective quasi-particle excitations of magnetic moments—offers a promising platform for next-generation, energy-saving information technology. Many magnonic structures have been proposed and studied in a range of designs, but a unified and scalable magnonic platform is still lacking.Here, we propose the design of magnonic integrated circuits that can in principle perform a large number of magnonic operations. [1] We use domain walls and surface anisotropy stripes as two different spin wave waveguides. The magnonic integrated circuits that we design include a single square magnetic wafer, which is analogous to a silicon wafer. We experiment with yttrium iron garnet thin film magnetic wafers of several sizes (roughly a few thousand nanometers on a side). Since the magnetic texture of our circuits can be easily modified, our magnonic hardware architecture is reprogrammable, unlike most present-day information-processing architectures. Using this new architecture, we design the simplest magnonic component, a spin wave diode that admits only the unidirectional propagation of spin waves. We find that the bound spin wave states in a domain wall become chiral and are spatially separated depending on their propagation direction, which enables us to realize the diode effect for spin wave transport. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the function of the spin wave diode is easily altered from forward-transmitting to reverse-transmitting by simply moving domain walls via current-induced spin-transfer torque. Our magnonic architecture opens up new pathways for realizing a pure spin wave computer.Reference:[1]. Lan, J., Yu, W., Wu, R. &amp; Xiao, J. Spin-Wave Diode. Phys. Rev.

By permanent noncoalescence and nonwetting we distinguish cases in which the phenomena may be observed for unlimited time from transient examples such as two drops of liquid bouncing off one another or a liquid droplet bouncing off a solid wall. To achieve permanent noncoalescence or nonwetting, a mechanism is needed for establishing a lubricating film of surrounding fluid (usually air) and sustaining this film as the liquid/liquid or solid/liquid surfaces are moved toward each other.\r\n\r\nOne technique for achieving these lubricating films is the use of thermocapillarity, the variation of a liquid’s surface tension with temperature. We have demonstrated that nonwetting may be achieved through non-contact, optical heating and that this may be further employed to levitate droplets above solid surfaces and to translate them along these surfaces. The implications of this technique for lab-on-a-chip applications will be discussed, along with items of more fundamental scientific interest.\r\n\r\nG.

Moreover, the continuous sample concentration and separation are not possible in the conventional IEF. To overcome these challenges, free flow isoelectric focusing (FFIEF) can be used in which a flow field is applied in the direction perpendicular to the applied electric field. However, efficient design of microfluidic chip is cumbersome for FFIEF process as one has to take care of both flow and electric field in addition to pH field. In this talk, we will present a new mathematical modelto study the roles of flow and electric fields for efficient design of microfluidic chip for continuous separation of proteins from an initial well mixed solution. Results obtained from our model will be compared with experimental data to demonstrate the efficacy of the model. Finally, a new channel design will be presented to increase the separation resolution by introducing cross-stream flow velocity. Our results indicate that the separation resolution can be improved by three folds in this new design compare to the conventional straight channel design used in traditional experiments.\r\n\r\nBiography:Prof. Prashanta Dutta received his MS and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the University of South Carolina and Texas A&amp;M University, respectively.

By modeling the interaction of wind energy’s intermittence and system operation, we reveal the incompatibility between the new technologies, old system operations, and climate-change policies. Our results suggest the incompatibility will weaken wind energy’s ability to reduce Greenhouse Gases and threat the efficiency of a carbon tax. We suggest that market regulators must reexamine the current market design and policy settings based on system-perspective-based data analysis. For example, we develop a criteria system to help market operators use wind-energy and market data to select an appropriate dispatch protocol. The criteria system is deduced by modeling the system dynamics of adopting different dispatch protocols to integrate wind energy into a power grid. An empirical study, which is calibrated according to the data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, confirms the effectiveness of the criteria system for dispatch protocol selection. By using the criteria system to adjusting the dispatch protocol, wind energy’s capability to reduce CO2 is improved by 30% in the ERCOT market. We also demonstrate that the stochastic dispatch must replace the static dispatch, which is currently used in most electricity markets, once a carbon tax is implemented. Actually, if a $6/ton carbon tax is implemented in the Texas market operated according to the stochastic protocol, the CO2 emission is similar to the emission level from the same market with a $16/ton carbon tax operated according to the static protocol. Correspondingly, the $16/ton carbon tax associated with the static protocol costs 42.6% more than the $6/ton carbon tax associated with the stochastic protocol.\r\nBio：Yang Yu is a Ph.D. Candidate in Stanford University.

Its revolutionary potential is now universally recognized. Data complexity, heterogeneity, scale, and timeliness make data analysis a clear bottleneck in many applications, due to the complexity of the patterns and lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms.\r\nAdvanced machine learning and data mining algorithms have been developed to address one or more challenges listed above. It is typical that the complexity of potential patterns may grow exponentially with respect to the data complexity, and so is the size of the pattern space. To avoid an exhaustive search through the pattern space, machine learning and data mining algorithms usually employ a greedy approach to search for a local optimum in the solution space, or use a branch-and-bound approach to seek optimal solutions, and consequently, are often implemented as iterative or recursive procedures. To improve efficiency, these algorithms often exploit the dependencies between potential patterns to maximize in-memory computation and/or leverage special hardware (such as GPU and FPGA) for acceleration.\r\nBiography: Wei Wang is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles and the director of the Scalable Analytics Institute (ScAi).

The discontinuity at the interface is universal in all applications like PN junction, catalysts, biomaterials, etc. Understanding interactions at the interface will bring us towards new materials and new applications. My presentation will show three major examples in my previous research. \r\nThe first part was using nanoparticles to achieve special thermoelectric materials, called phonon glass electron crystal materials. The name of these materials come from their low thermal conductivity and high electric conductivity, which give them outstanding thermoelectric performance. However, the high cost and special skills were required. In my work, interfaces of nanoparticles actually scattered phonon but still can form network after spark plasma sintering, therefore, significantly lowered the cost of preparing such materials. \r\nThe second part was anti-virus materials, including visible like powered materials and external-condition-free materials. The key advantage was optimizing surfaces of the materials to increase interaction chance between viron and materials. \r\nThe third part was about stem cell and ultrastructure of hydrogels. The current research of hydrogel have not made any conclusion for the ultrastructure of them, which was a very basic problem in tissue engineering. My work unveiled the structure of gelatin based hydrogel and analyzed its pore distribution that was an important step for understanding stem cell migration problems. \r\nBy investigating interfaces and optimizing interactions, I believe we can design new functional materials and find new applications for current available materials. \r\n\r\nBiography:Ding Weng received his M.Sc. from Tsinghua University before moving to the University of California, Los Angeles, United States, where he obtained his Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. Yunfeng Lu in 2012.

Advancing perovskite solar cell technologies toward higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) requires delicate control over the perovskite film and the relevant interfaces, and deep understanding of defects. The properties of the perovskite can be manipulated (or optimized) during film growth by careful control of the intercalation reaction between the organic and inorganic species. We developed two approach for perovskite film growth: 1) vapor assisted solution process, and 2) one-step solution process with enhanced film reconstruction under controlled humidity. The underlying film growth mechanism, defect property and the corresponding device performance have been carefully examined. We further control the carrier dynamics throughout the entire device, based on careful choices of the carrier transport materials, and the modification of electrodes. These efforts lead to suppressed carrier recombination in the absorber, efficient carrier injection into the carrier transport layers, and good carrier extraction at the electrodes. The fabrication of our perovskite solar cells was conducted in air and from solution at low temperatures, which should simplify future manufacturing of high performance, low-cost, and large-area perovskite solar cells. \r\n\r\nBiography:Dr. Qi Chen holds both his B.S and M.S degrees in Tsinghua University.

The milestone year was 2004, when superconducting qubits have been integrated within a microwave cavity in order to reach, for the very first time in the condensed matter context, the strong coupling regime between photons and matter [1,2]. Since then, many other systems have been successfully coupled to microwave cavities, such as quantum wires [3], carbon nanotubes [4], quantum dots [5], etc. Such hybrid systems offer platforms for new kinds of physics, as one can engineer and manipulate the electromagnetic environment at will.The versatility of the cQED method relies on the fact that it allows to 1) monitor in a non-invasive fashion the electronic states in quantum conductors, both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations, 2) to affect and manipulate the electronic transport, 3) to establish long-range correlations between remote quantum conductors and, finally, 4) it opens the pathway to create non-classical states of light by means of electronic transport.In my talk, I will discuss some of these aspects for various types of quantum conductors. I will focus mainly on two types of systems: one dimensional p-wave (or topological) mesoscopic superconductors, and semiconductor quantum dots. The former system is known to host zero energy end modes known as Majorana fermions, i. e. particles that are their own antiparticle. These exotic objects are robust against local perturbations and, moreover, they obey non-Abelian statistics under braiding operations, thus recommending them as qubits for the implementation of a topological quantum computer. The latter systems have been shown to emulate the nature-given atoms and their electronic level structure but, as opposed to atoms, they can be easily addressed in electronic transport. While seemingly different, these systems can be probed in a similar fashion by utilizing the photons in a cavity. I will show that the cavity photons give direct access to various electronic susceptibilities of these quantum conductors. For the topological superconductor, I will show that both the so called topological phase transition [6], as well as the presence Majorana fermions (and some of their peculiar properties) [7], can be inferred from the cavity field. For the case of quantum dots, I will show that one can reveal properties that are invisible in electronic transport (via the conductance), in particular in out-of-equilibrium situations pertaining to a large voltage bias applied over the quantum dot [8].Finally, I will also touch upon the photonic statistics emitted by a voltage biased quantum conductor. Specifically, I will describe a voltage biased Josephson junction coupled to two resonators of incommensurate frequencies. Using a density approach to analyze the cavity fields and an input-output description to analyze the emitted photonic fluxes and their correlation functions, I will show that the emitted radiation is non-classical in the sense that the photonic correlators violate some Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities [9]. I will confront the theory with some recent experimental studies where such violations have been measured [10].\r\nReferences:[1] A. Wallraf, D. I. Schuster, A.

They have been extensively used for genetic transfection, virotherapy, vaccines, drug delivery, imaging agents, and materials science. Despite these successes, bottom-up anti-virus biomolecular engineering still presents three substantial challenges: membrane protein, complex assembly, and bioconjugation. Here we adopt a cell-free synthetic biology strategy to address those three challenges. Cell-free synthetic biology is emerging as a powerful interdisciplinary bioengineering approach aimed to harness and expand the capabilities of natural biological systems without using intact cells. It enables proper folding of viral membrane protein, expression of proteins toxic to cells, fast high-throughput screening, controllable virus particle assembly, and incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins for bioorthogonal conjugation. We use cell-free synthetic biology to design and produce universal influenza vaccine and genome-free virus-like particle for human health applications. The resulting trimeric influenza hemagglutinin stem domain could be used as a potentially broadly protective influenza vaccine. The virus-like particle is extensively modified to improve its functional properties for better vaccine design, drug delivery, and cancer therapy. \r\n\r\nBiography:\r\nYuan Lu received his B.S.

With the emerging and maturing of a new acceleration technology based on plasmas, the overall landscape could be changed, or could they? This new technology, named plasma based wakefield acceleration, can accelerate charged particles with more than 1000 times larger gradient, therefore it can shrink a kilometer scale monster onto a tabletop toy.

Since expanding the infrastructures is complex, slow and costly, the key to relieving the tense between the rapidly increasing customer demands and slowly ramping-up infrastructures is to highly utilize the existing resources and strongly protect application performance simultaneously.\r\nIn this talk, I will present two projects which help cloud providers to find a good balance between efficiency and robustness in their infrastructures. First, in network traffic management, we propose the concept of “Forward Fault Correction (FFC)” which proactively prevents a network from congestion caused by faults like configuration, link and device failures. FFC requires a traffic engineering (TE) to guarantee no congestion without reconfiguring the network as long as the number of faults is under k. The challenges to realize FFC lie in the overhead in network throughput and the computational complexity to prepare for a huge number of fault cases. We develop an efficient and uniform method to obtain a TE with FFC under diverse kinds of faults.\r\nNext, I will present the design of the next generation of Microsoft’s online service delivery infrastructure, called Footprint. Footprint jointly coordinates all key routing and resource allocation decisions, to achieve high efficiency and low risk. It decides how to map users to frontend proxies, proxies to backend datacenters, and traffic to network paths, and configures all infrastructure components involved in service delivery, including network switches, proxies, load balancers, and DNS servers to achieve this mapping. We show that fully realizing the potential of the joint control on infrastructure requires faithful modeling of system dynamics. A major issue is that after we change system configuration, its impact is not immediate but manifests only gradually. To capture temporal variations, we model system load and performance as a function of time. Solving time-based models can be intractable (e.g., time is continuous), but we show how all load and performance constraints can be met by considering a small number of time points.\r\n\r\nShort Bio：\r\nHongqiang (Harry) Liu is a Postdoctoral Researcher in Microsoft Research, Redmond Lab.

The milestone year was 2004, when superconducting qubits have been integrated within a microwave cavity in order to reach, for the very first time in the condensed matter context, the strong coupling regime between photons and matter [1,2]. Since then, many other systems have been successfully coupled to microwave cavities, such as quantum wires [3], carbon nanotubes [4], quantum dots [5], etc. Such hybrid systems offer platforms for new kinds of physics, as one can engineer and manipulate the electromagnetic environment at will. The versatility of the cQED method relies on the fact that it allows to 1) monitor in a non-invasive fashion the electronic states in quantum conductors, both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations, 2) to affect and manipulate the electronic transport, 3) to establish long-range correlations between remote quantum conductors and, finally, 4) it opens the pathway to create non-classical states of light by means of electronic transport. In my talk, I will discuss some of these aspects for various types of quantum conductors. I will focus mainly on two types of systems: one dimensional p-wave (or topological) mesoscopic superconductors, and semiconductor quantum dots. The former system is known to host zero energy end modes known as Majorana fermions, i. e. particles that are their own antiparticle. These exotic objects are robust against local perturbations and, moreover, they obey non-Abelian statistics under braiding operations, thus recommending them as qubits for the implementation of a topological quantum computer. The latter systems have been shown to emulate the nature-given atoms and their electronic level structure but, as opposed to atoms, they can be easily addressed in electronic transport. While seemingly different, these systems can be probed in a similar fashion by utilizing the photons in a cavity. I will show that the cavity photons give direct access to various electronic susceptibilities of these quantum conductors. For the topological superconductor, I will show that both the so called topological phase transition [6], as well as the presence Majorana fermions (and some of their peculiar properties) [7], can be inferred from the cavity field. For the case of quantum dots, I will show that one can reveal properties that are invisible in electronic transport (via the conductance), in particular in out-of-equilibrium situations pertaining to a large voltage bias applied over the quantum dot [8]. Finally, I will also touch upon the photonic statistics emitted by a voltage biased quantum conductor. Specifically, I will describe a voltage biased Josephson junction coupled to two resonators of incommensurate frequencies. Using a density approach to analyze the cavity fields and an input-outputdescription to analyze the emitted photonic fluxes and their correlation functions, I will show that the emitted radiation is non-classical in the sense that the photonic correlators violate some Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities [9]. I will confront the theory with some recent experimental studies where such violations have been measured [10].\r\nReferences:[1] A. Wallraf, D. I. Schuster, A.

One technique we use is called helium spin echo spectroscopy, the setup is essentially a time resolved atom interferometer, which is capable of measuring atomic scale motion which takes place on a time scale of pico to nanoseconds[1], a range which is inaccessible using conventional surface science techniques. I will explain the basic principles of the technique and the experimental apparatus, and present as an example a recent study where we used this apparatus to study the fast and highly correlated diffusive motion of sodium atoms on a nano-structured surface[2]. Using molecular dynamics simulations for the interpretation of the data, we extract the energy barrier for diffusion, a lower limit for the Schwoebel barrier and also observe a non-isotropic repulsive interaction between the Na atoms which is attributed to a screening effect of the atomic step[2]. A second different research project, I will briefly describe, is an attempt to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study surface structure and dynamics. NMR is a particularly sensitive technique which is often used to determine atomic-scale structure and dynamics in the bulk, however, it is hardly used in surface science due to its low detection sensitivity. We have demonstrated that a high purity ortho-H2O beam can be obtained using simple magnetic manipulations[3-4].

Recently further interest is growing in public health with novel opportunities for spatial statistics. In this presentation, some recent developments are given. First, an important issue concerns a geospatial analysis of HIV-related social stigma that focused on females across Indian mandals. Data were available at a very detailed level. Issues of stichma are addressed and are related to data quality. Second, attention is given towards relating buruli ulcer with soil and groundwater related variables. CAR based modeling was applied on villages in Ghana. A better understanding with possible relations to public health is investigated. Finally, attention is given towards spatial dependency of cholera prevalence on potential cholera reservoirs in an urban area. Hierarchcial modeling and Bayesian structured additive regression modeling were carried out. Both spatial and spatial temporal data were analyzed. Its occurrence may have a large effect on positioning of cholera treatment facilities.\r\n\r\n主讲人简介：\r\n Alfred Stein is a Professor of spatial statistics and image analysis with the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands.

The crucial parameter for ferromagnet(F)|normal metal(N) interfaces is the spin mixing conductance that governs the absorption of a transverse spin current and the spin transfer torque. However, the spin-mixing conductance is a purely nonrelativistic concept, while there is mounting evidence that spin-orbit interactions at interfaces generate additional spin-flips and spin-orbit torques. We have solved this issue by introducing an “effective” spin mixing conductance for weakly relativistic materials. First ab initio results on ferrite|metal interface indeed indicate an enhancement that can be very significant for selected crystal orientations. \r\n\r\nMassive particles, i.e. the electrons, as well as quasi particles, i.e. magnons, can carry a thermal spin current that generates torques at the interfaces. Based on the same theoretical frame as effective mixing conductance, we compute both kind of torques for magnetic tunnel junctions from first principles in order to validate their spin transfer power e&#64259;ciency, switching speed, etc. ","speaker":{"name":"夏钶","affiliation":" Department of Physics, BUN"},"subtime":"2016-09-18T13:24:20Z","uid":"579836f69ed5db021a74f6b7","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57de95869ed5dbfb32993609","type":0,"title":"Modeling for environment and safety","img":"","location":{"country":"China","city":"Beijing","address":"清华大学蒙民伟科技大楼北楼N-408室"},"time":{"from":"2016-03-03T01:30:00Z","to":"2016-03-03T02:30:00Z"},"activityHost":{"unit":"清华大学航院流体力学研究所","school":"清华大学","address":""},"abstract":"报告内容： \r\nThe recent advances in high fidelity modeling and high performance computing today make numerical simulation a powerful tool to study and control unsteady reacting turbulent atmospheric flows.

The elastomers are prepared by sequential swelling and polymerization steps resulting in highly entangled networks combining a high modulus (3 MPa), fully reversible deformation (&lt;3% of residual strain) and ahigh toughness (5 kJ/m2)1. \r\nThe resulting materials have a population of elastic chains with a broad level of prestretching and hence failure strain.

A few interesting issues have been discussed so far such as charge density waves (CDW), non-Fermi liquid behavior, and giant Rashba splitting. In this talk, I will review our recent work on the topological nature of indium atomic wires on Si(111) in its CDW ground state [1], which lead us to new topological physics. In this well known system, we recently succeeded in directly observing individual soliton excitations within its CDW band gap [2]. It has been known that 1D Peierls chains are 1D topological insulators and solitons are their edge states protected topologically. Each indium atomic wire on Si(111) is composed of double Peierls chains, which yield uniquely four, not two, degenerate ground states. This fourfold degeneracy corresponds to the first materials realization of a Z4 topological insulator as revealed its band structure [3]. In turn, this unique topology brings about three distinct soliton edge states within the band gap as clearly observed in scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy [4]. These solitons are endowed with chirality, which corresponds to the chiral edge current of higher dimensional topological insulators [4]. We thus for the first time clarify the 1D chiral edge state of a 1D topological insulator. The exciting prospect of utilizing chiral solitons for the topologically-protected multi-level informatics, which I would call ‘chiral solitonics,’ is introduced. \r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

However, there still remains a lack of closely lattice-matched materials and substrates suitable for the grand integration of various kinds of semiconductor optoelectronic and electronic devices on a single chip. I have recently proposed a new material platform: the II-VI (MgZnCd)(SeTe) and III-V (AlGaIn)(PAsSb) semiconductor materials lattice-matched to InAs, GaSb and InSb substrates. The binaries, alloys, and their quantum structures (quantum well and superlattice) of the platform have direct bandgaps covering a very broad energy spectrum from far IR (&lt; 0 eV) to UV (~3.4 eV). This feature is not achievable by any other known lattice-matched semiconductors on any commercially available substrates. Such a unique material platform enables new light emitting devices, multi-junction solar cells, multi-color photodetectors, high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), resonant tunneling diodes, and facilitates monolithic integration of various materials without misfit dislocations to ensure the best quality for device applications. This talk will focus on the latest progress of the MBE growth of the materials and their applications in these devices. It will also touch the potential about the use of the materials platform to study fundamental science like topological insulators and related new quantum materials. \r\nBrief Bio: Professor Zhang received his BS in Physics from Nanjing Normal University in 1982 and MS from the Institute of Semiconductor, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 1987, and did his research at the Max Planck Institute for Solid States and received this doctoral degree in physics from the University of Stuttgart in 1991.

If low cloud cover increases as the climate warms, the increased planetary albedo implies a damping feedback on climate changes; if low cloud cover decreases as the climate warms, the reduced albedo implies an amplifying feedback. Existing theories and climate models do not even agree on the sign of low-cloud cover changes as the climate warms, much less on the magnitude. Observations can now constrain the sign of the low-cloud feedback, but do not cover a sufficiently long period to constrain its magnitude well. To constrain and understand cloud feedbacks, we use a hierarchical modeling framework in which large-eddy simulations (LES), validated with data for the present climate, are driven on the large scale by environmental conditions derived from observations or climate model simulations. Insights gained from such climatically relevant LES are then used to infer mechanisms and the magnitude of the low-cloud response to climate change. The result is that low-cloud feedback is robustly positive, with a magnitude likely in the upper half of that simulated by current climate models.","speaker":{"name":"Tapio Schneider","affiliation":" Frank J.

当然，所有不谈福利的招聘都是耍流氓 今日头条相信，年轻人不应该在郊区工作生活。我们的办公地位于北京三环，据说符合条件的同学每个月还有一千五的住房补贴。 公司拥有自己的食堂，一日三餐全包，汤粥饮料水果样样齐全。妈妈再也不用担心我的伙食了。工作一天，腰酸腿疼怎么办？我不会告诉你，公司自带健身房，瑜伽室，甚至你还能在公司预约个按摩。办公环境更不用说了，我们的玛丽奥会议室是这样的，我们天台的秘（jia）密（ban）花（ju）园（dian）是这样的：听上去是不是很不错？当天聊完技术之后，我们的HR同学会跟大家详细聊聊我们的福利。如果你想要了解更多招聘信息，扫描二维码关注公众号头条校园。\n宣讲会行程是不是已经等不及了？快点击阅读原文进入网申通道，加入我们吧。","speaker":{"name":"今日头条","affiliation":"基于数据挖掘技术的个性化推荐引擎产品","bio":"今日头条校园宣讲正式启动啦。9月20日19:00我们在清华大学二教401，和你不见不散。\n先向同学们介绍一下今日头条 “今日头条”是一款基于数据挖掘技术的个性化推荐引擎产品，它为用户推荐有价值的、个性化的信息，提供连接人与信息的新型服务，是国内移动互联网领域成长最快的产品之一。 上线四年，今日头条的总用户数已经超过5.5亿，每天都有超过6000万用户使用今日头条，人均使用时长超过76分钟。不知道大家对这些数字有没有概念，实际上，在用户时长这个指标上，我们在所有APP中已经仅次于微信（不包括一些用户数特很小的APP）。我们是一家快速成长的互联网公司。如果大家关注互联网，应该知道移动互联网时代中国出现了一批独角兽公司（估值10亿美金）。第三方数据公司最新给我们的估值是92亿美金，这意味着，我们已经跻身超级独角兽行列，在移动互联网时代真正有机会成为平台级的一家公司。 前段时间曾传出腾讯要80亿美金收购我们的消息，不过一鸣说了，做别人家的员工没有意思，我们是要“go big or go home”的。在内部，一鸣经常说的一句话是，我们要做一家千亿级别的互联网公司。 公司在快速发展，必然也就面临着更多的挑战，拥有更多的机会。我们的愿景是希望成为最“懂你”的信息平台，连接信息与人，促进创作与交流。要实现这样的愿景，我们需要优秀的毕业生加入头条。\n接下来，跟大家聊聊头条的技术优势 和很多人认为的不同，今日头条不是媒体，我们没有编辑，所有信息的推荐发布都是由机器完成的。 我们是一家技术驱动的互联网公司，今日头条的初始团队和创始人都是程序员出身，目前公司的技术类员工超过三分之一。每日处理请求数据14亿、用户画像数据高达140T。海量数据背后，是对技术能力的极大考验。今年，今日头条成立了专注于人工智能和机器学习的头条实验室，负责研究那些机器人写稿、机器人配图、机器人自动问答等等好玩又黑科技的事儿。 负责人李磊博士是原本能靠颜值吃饭却用了才华的小鲜肉，不久前他和实验室实习生吴翼开发出的swift编译系统，把概率程序语言的运算速度提高了60-100倍。","position":"","img":"//static.aminer.org/upload/act/avatar/1999/1011/464/57e0def79ed5db79ab8a965a.png"},"subtime":"2016-09-20T07:04:07Z","uid":"566f891645ce0bb16f69c2e0","edited":false,"activityLike":[]},{"id":"57e102389ed5db79ab8aa119","type":1,"title":"CCF

The conservation equations, multicomponent fluxes, transport coefficients, thermodynamics, and chemical production rates are derived from the kinetic theory. The system of partial differential equations is symmetrizable hyperbolic-parabolic and involves stiff sources. Uniform a priori estimates are obtained and lead to global existence results for well prepared initial conditions extending previous results with nonstiff sources. Chemical equilibrium fluids, on the other hand, describe the conservation of atomic elements, momentum and energy. By combining estimates out of equilibrium with stability results for perturbed systems at chemical equilibrium, we establish convergence towards the chemical equilibrium fluid model when chemistry times go to zero. \r\n报告人简介: Prof. Vincent Giovangigli is a research director at CNRS (French National Center for Scientific Research) Ecole Polytechnique, Center for Applied Mathematics.

Recent investigations have shown that sewage sludge contains considerable amounts of pathogenic germs, drugs, hormones, carcinogenic and mutagenic substances.\r\nIncineration of sewage sludge in the fluidized bed is able to establish a sink in the food chain by thermally destroying these latter contaminants.\r\nSewage sludge on the other hand can in the future become a valuable resource. This is particularly valid for phosphorus as a fertilizer material. Presently available mineral fertilizers rely on phosphate production from phosphate rock which is a finite resource. The European Union has just in 2016 put phosphorus on their list of 20 raw materials considered critical for the EU.\r\nAt present, several processes are under development to recover P from sewage water, sludge or ash. However, costs of recycling products exceed prices of mineral fertilizers based on phosphate rock.\r\nAt the Waste Water Treatment Plant Ulm the strategy is to produce a \"clean\" sewage sludge which after incineration leads to an ash which satisfies the quality requirements of the German Fertilizer ordinance. This strategy implies a strict quality control of the incoming effluent. An additional cleaning step i.e. a contact reactor with activated carbon followed by a filter enhances the P recovery and its transfer into the sludge. The optimization of the Waste Water Treatment Plant and the incineration leads to a high efficiency of the total P recovery from the waste water to the ash product of 97.8 %.\r\nThe plant availability of phosphorus in recycling products is still under discussion among experts. It is the neutral-ammonium-citrate solubility which is considered to describe that part of the total P which is 100 % plant available during one growing season.

After a brief stint on the faculty at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Dr. Dorn moved to the University of Cincinnati where he rose through the ranks to become Chief of the Division of Cardiology and Associate Dean for Cardiovascular Services. During this period, Dorn’s interest in G-protein coupled neurohormonal signaling pathways that mediate cardiac hypertrophy and its progression to heart failure bore early fruit as a series of genetic mouse models in which cardiac-specific manipulation of Gαq or its downstream effectors activated intrinsic genetic programs for cardiomyocyte growth and/or programmed death. As Principal Investigator of NHLBI P50 SCOR and SCCOR programs at the University of Cincinnati, Dorn and his co-investigators began studying human genetic variants linked to heart disease, modeling the human polymorphisms and mutations in experimental systems for mechanistic investigations. Dorn moved to Washington University in St. Louis in 2008 to become the inaugural Philip and Sima K Needleman Professor and the Associate Chair (Internal Medicine) for Translational Research. The Dorn laboratory investigates multiple aspects of genetic reprogramming in heart failure, with research efforts in cardiac signaling and mitochondrial mechanisms of heart, and increasingly neurological, disease. Their recent efforts have elucidated mechanistic interactions between mitochondrial dynamics proteins, mitophagy factors, and mitochondrial biogenesis pathways in the heart and neurological system, identifying processes for cardiomyocyte mitochondrial and metabolic maturation and neuronal degeneration.

Examples are the structural and dimensional synthesis of mechanisms, the generation of real-time dynamics codes, up to the efficient modeling of biomechanical interactions in human gait motion. In this talk, two examples of minimal-coordinate kinematical approaches in multibody analysis and biomechanics are discussed, showing their potentials to tackle non-trivial research problems.As a first example, a particular interpretation of multiloop mechanisms as systems of coupled kinematical loops – termed the kinematical network – is presented. By this concept, closed-form solutions can be generated for many practical cases, which allow one (a) to produce highly efficient codes for the dynamical equations, including mixed subsystems of differing subgroup dimensionality in SE(3), such as planar, cylindrical and spherical motions, and (b) to resolve open challenges in structural rigidity detection, such as the double banana or the 7-roof problem of nucleationfree mechanisms. By embedding the ensuing relative kinematics in an abstract differential-geometric setting, the main operations of reduction to minimal coordinates for the dynamical equations are shown to be representable by generic mappings between manifolds and their tangent and cotangent spaces as well as their metrics, yielding the different methodologies for generation of the dynamical equations as ``flavors’’ of the generic mappings in an object-oriented framework. This is also shown to be useful for the problem of interpolation and optimization of motion in 3D space under dynamical effects, as applicable for example to roller-coaster layout, time-optimal path planning, optimal skiing motion, and reconstruction of the human spine motion from camera-tracked skin markers.As a second example, some novel minimal-coordinate approaches for the efficient biomechanical modeling of the human musculoskeletal system will be presented. These include a novel approach for the real-time computation of musculotendon paths using geodesic variations as well as a holonomic foot-ground contact model for forward dynamic simulations. With these, direct feedback of musculoskeletal motion in clinical settings becomes more reachable, as will be shown with our object-oriented biomechanics simulation environment.Although the foregoing examples by far do not cover all current open issues in kinematics, they may help in illustrating its key role at the core of many open quests in mechanism analysis, multibody dynamics, and biomechanics.","speaker":{"name":"Andrés Kecskeméthy","affiliation":"University of Duisburg-Essen","bio":"Professor Andrés Kecskeméthy, born in Lima, Perú, graduated from the University of Stuttgart in Mechanical Engineering in 1984 and received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Duisburg in 1993, both with distinction.

Once a mechanism type is selected, the appropriate dimensions can often be determined by solving a system of polynomial equations. The task of type selection, however, is not so amenable to mathematical treatment, and requires a level of intuition that may take many years to develop and is difficult to pass on.The goal of this research is to advance the science of mechanism design and lead to practical and efficient design tools capable of solving highly complex motion generation problems faced by machine designers. Central to this research is the creation of a new computational framework for simultaneous type and dimensional synthesis of various mechanisms.

Various transition metal oxides with redox ability have been investigated under electrochemical conditions. They have been used as oxygen electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, which are critical reactions for developing renewable energy technologies like fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and water electrolyzers. This presentation will present a systematic study on spinel oxides’ redox ability and oxygen electrocatalysis. [1,2] Starting with a model system of Mn-Co spinel, the presentation will introduce the correlation of oxygen catalytic activities of these oxides and their intrinsic chemical properties. The catalytic activity was measured by rotating disk technique and the intrinsic chemical properties were probed by synchrotron X-ray absorption techniques. It was found that molecular orbital theory is able to well-explain their activities.[3,4] The attention was further extended from cubic Mn-Co spinels to tetragonal Mn-Co spinels and it was found that the molecular theory is again dominant in determining the catalytic activies. This mechanistic principle is further applied to explain the ORR/OER activities of other spinels containing other transition metals (Fe, Ni, Zn, Li, and etc.). \r\nReferences[1] Wei C, Feng Z, Baisariyev M, Yu L, Zeng L, Wu T, Zhao H, Huang Y, Bedzyk M, Sritharan T, Xu Z, Chemistry of Materials, 2016, 28, 4129.[2] Wei C, Feng Z, Scherer G, Barber J, Shao-Horn Y, Xu Z, submitted.[3] Suntivich J, Gasteiger, HA, Yabuuchi, N, Nakanishi H, Goodenough, JB, Shao-Horn, Y.

Since those days, oxides have been the backbone of many scientific and technological developments. When high temperature superconductors were discovered, the subsequent enthusiasm stimulated an impressive development in oxide thin film growth technologies and a deep revision of the understanding of metal oxides and strongly correlated electronic systems. Today, oxides are fueling the discovery and development of unexpected, intriguing, and fascinating new areas of knowledge, such as magnetic ferroelectrics and magnetic monopoles. Ferromagnetic oxides are finding their way as active components in spintronics, either as spin filters for advantageous magnetic tunnel junctions or used to manipulate spins in non-magnetic materials, which could eventually lead to energy-efficient pure spin-current devices. The tiny spin-orbit coupling interaction, responsible for the magnetic anisotropy, has emerged as a toy that allows us the modulation of the transport properties, not only in metallic ferromagnetic systems, but also in antiferromagnetic metals and insulators. This may lead to a new generation of magnetic memory. “Interface is the device” and interfaces between oxides and metals, and interfaces between large band-gap oxides, have led to the discovery of emerging properties such as switchable “on-off” magnetization, by applying suitable electric fields, or magnetism and superconductivity in confined two-dimensional electron gas systems, which challenge our current understanding of oxides. This is the playground in which we fortunately play, learn, and imagine the future while enjoying building a new science out of the good old oxides. In the lecture, we will travel through the new materials and ideas that make this journey possible and so successful. \r\nBiographyJosep Fontcuberta received the Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Barcelona in 1982. He was postdoctoral researcher at the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at Oxford University and later was appointed assistant professor in the Physics Faculty of the University of Barcelona. In 1991 he moved to the Institut de Ciència de Materials de Barcelona (ICMAB-CSIC), where he is a full research professor. He is mainly interested in functional oxides. These strongly correlated electronic systems display fascinating ferroic orders (i.e., magnetic, ferroelectric) and remarkable magneto-electric and optic properties, which have motivated his research and that of the Multifunctional Thin Films and Complex Structures Group he leads. Currently, the group research activities are focused on materials and devices that may contribute to a more a sustainable world. Pep Fontcuberta is co-author of over 400 scientific papers.

Sometimes, seemingly complex structures can be created by simple objects, and flexible soft materials can be fabricated through self-assembly of hard matters. In this lecture, I will first show the hierarchical structures created using simple Janus motif. Janus amphiphilic particles can be viewed as a colloidal version of surfactant, and form unique clusters and fibrillar structures through supracolloidal assembly. Single particle tracking revealed unique kinetic pathways. In a 2D crystal formed by Janus particles, positioned in an ordered hexagonal lattice, particle rotation was highly correlated and demonstrated glassy dynamics. Furthermore, I will discuss different fabrication methods and using Janus particles to stabilize emulsions. Finally, I will demonstrate how nanoparticle assembly can help improve material performance in biomedical and coating applications. \r\nShort bio:Dr. Shan Jiang is an Assistant Professor in the Materials Science and Engineering department at Iowa State University.
